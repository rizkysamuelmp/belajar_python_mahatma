teen VOGUE;23 September 2025;"Olivia Rodrigo Paired Ultra Low-Rise Jeans With the Cutest Keyhole Top
Less is, indeed, more.";"Olivia Rodrigo is crossing the ultimate Y2K dressing frontier and giving one of the most divisive trends of the early 2000s her stamp of approval. Yes, folks, we are talking about low-rise jeans.

In her latest Instagram photo dump, Olivia Rodrigo officially proclaimed herself as a member of team low-rise jeans, and she did so with the cutest outfit combo. In the fourth slide of her Instagram post, Rodrigo was all smiles, posing in the streets of London wearing a pair of stonewash ultra low-rise jeans, which she paired with the Guizio Ara Top in cream.";;https://www.teenvogue.com/story/olivia-rodrigo-paired-ultra-low-rise-jeans-with-the-cutest-keyhole-top
;;;"This is, of course, not the first time we've seen Rodrigo in a low-rise silhouette or in jeans; however, her style evolution has more often than not favored mid- and high-rise denim, so it's definitely one of the first times we've seen a combination of both.";;
;;;Rodrigo's top of choice, made from 100% polyester chiffon and available in seven colorways, was the perfect complement to the low-rise jeans, creating a barely-there midriff peek that showcased her lower abdomen.;;
;;;"The Ara Top, which everyone online seems to be obsessed with, also features a built-in scarf detail, flutter sleeves, and, to add to the peekaboo effect, a keyhole center that extends to the bodice with button-up detailing. Less is, indeed, more — at least when it comes to the fabric construction of these pieces.

If you thought Rodrigo's homage to the '00s ended with her jeans, think again. The star also added a thick silver bangle, another Y2K staple, as well as just a hint of leopard print with her $258 Kate Spade bag.

Marie Claire;16 November 2024;"Olivia Rodrigo Lets Her Y2K Gucci Thong and Pencil Skirt Do the Talking at the Billboard Live Music Summit
The pop star gave her rare designer vintage look a sexy edge with exposed lingerie at the event.";Olivia Rodrigo doesn't mind one bit if you can see her underwear. In fact, that was kind of the point of her outfit at the Billboard Live Music Summit in Los Angeles on Thursday. Before collecting her award for touring artist of the year, the pop star pulled up to the 1 Hotel in West Hollywood wearing a pitch-perfect Y2K look packed with covetable vintage designer finds.;;https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/olivia-rodrigo-gucci-thong-pencil-skirt/
;;;The crown jewel of the ensemble was an icy blue low-rise pencil skirt with a small slit in the back from Gucci’s Spring/Summer 1998 collection designed by Tom Ford. With an indelible sheen akin to glistening snow, the same baby blue silk satin was also used to create a jacket and trousers for the collection. Underneath the skirt, Rodrigo flashed a glimpse of her black patent leather G-string thong with rhinestone logo buckles. Both the exposed thong and her strappy cropped black tank top come from Tom Ford's Spring/Summer 1998 collection for Gucci as well. The two pieces are generally sold as a set along with a black bodycon skirt, per Ford's original runway styling. But I like Rodrigo's colorful remixed version of the look—most likely styled by Chloe and Chenelle Delgadillo—quite a lot.;;
;;;"Rodrigo accessorized the ensemble with Amina Muaddi black satin Mary Jane pumps, Tiffany & Co. white diamond knot earrings, and a matching diamond-encrusted Tiffany Knot ring. Her nails were painted a punchy red for a pop of color that complemented her signature brownish red glossy lip. The rest of her glam was similarly classic with her long brunette hair styled in a sleek blowout and her eyes framed with black cat-eye liner. Rodrigo has been a Glossier ambassador for years, so her razor-thin flick was probably created using the brand's Pro Tip liquid eyeliner.

";;
;;;In a post-naked dressing trend world, almost nothing feels shocking anymore. Nudity is practically encouraged at red carpet events, and the trend has even wormed its way into the everyday closets of women whose job descriptions don't include being a pop star. That said, there remains something irresistibly fun and alluring about an exposed thong peeking out from a celebrity's waistline. It may not be risqué, but the G-string still knows how to command attention.;;
Cosmopolitan;15 November 2024;"Olivia Rodrigo’s Tank Top, Pencil Skirt, and Bejeweled G-String Are Straight Out of the ‘00s
Iconic.";"Showing the straps of your underwear beneath a put-together outfit sounds like it should be a fashion faux pas. And yet, there was nothing chicer in the noughties than exposing your thong. Wearing the spaghetti-thin straps of your G-string (yes, it had to be a G-string; Brazilian undies wouldn’t have achieved the same ~lewk~) high up on your hips so they sat above the low-rise waistband of your skirts, jeans, and Juicy Couture velour sweatpants were the very definition of peak Y2K style.";;https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a62919283/olivia-rodrigo-exposed-thong-y2k-outfit/
;;;"If the above triggers post-traumatic stress-inducing flashbacks, we suggest you stop reading now because Olivia Rodrigo has recreated this exact trend in her latest outfit. Stepping out at the Billboard Live Music Summit in Hollywood last night (November 14), the artist repped an ensemble that was straight out of the ‘00s. Obvi, of course, the entire thing is kinda ironic given the 21-year-old was just a bb at the height of the exposed thong’s sartorial reign.

";;
;;;Donning a cropped black tank top that featured double shoulder straps with buckle decoration and a pale blue metallic knee-length skirt, the straps of Olivia’s black G-string thong were clearly visible over the waistband of her pencil skirt. Crystal-embellished buckle straps adorning each side strap drew further attention to her underwear. Peep the bejeweled detailing for yourself:;;
;;;"In addition to nailing the Y2K trend, the musician’s blingy thong also perfectly coordinated with her silver stud earrings, which were enhanced with additional sparkle. Black square-toe satin Mary Jane heels completed the entire look and lended a further retro feel.

Near;26 Februari 2025;Notes on a Gen Z Icon: A+ Digital Marketing Lessons to Learn from Olivia Rodrigo;"Every generation has artists who have gotten them through life’s happiest and angstiest moments – a musician whose albums they listen to while commuting, whose lyrics they have found themselves crying to at least a couple of points in their lives, and whose music they have posted on their social media to tell mutuals how much they can #relate.

Now that we’re well into the era ruled by Generation Z, it’s pretty clear who the reigning voice is and it is none other than Olivia Rodrigo. A peek into her colorful career gives brands, creators, and even marketers valuable lessons on how to market to today’s audience effectively.";;https://nearcreative.co/blog/gen-z-marketing-lessons-inspired-by-olivia-rodrigo
;;;"Authenticity on Steroids
From Sour to Guts, Olivia Rodrigo captured listeners worldwide for her confessional songwriting. Her songs are filled with honest expressions of heartache, anxiety, and the omnipresent fear of growing up. These big emotions are not exclusive to this generation, of course, but since her breakout, Olivia Rodrigo’s music has resonated with Gen Z because it touches their need for something that feels raw, unscripted, and genuine. And since the young musician is known to be deeply involved in the creative process of her albums, no one doubts that whatever she puts out truly comes from her heart.

Gen Z doesn’t just want to be entertained. They crave content that feels honest and real, and not like someone is trying to sell them something.";;
;;;"Affinity for Nostalgia
If you’re a millennial who has felt a connection to Olivia Rodrigo’s music because of how much it reminds you of what you listened to growing up, then you’re not alone. The Fil-Am musician draws influences from the likes of millennial favorites Paramore and Taylor Swift, whom she even gave songwriting creds on her hits “good 4 u” and “deja vu,” respectively.

And Olivia Rodrigo isn’t the only one riding the nostalgia wave. Generation Z is leading the trend, whether it be in the music they gravitate towards or their fashion preferences. There is a collective longing for simpler times that’s so specific to Gen Z because they are growing up in a time of rapid, chaotic change in the world, so they love things that capture a sense of nostalgia.";"Affinity for Nostalgia

;;;"Attention to Culture
Lastly, and most importantly, Olivia Rodrigo has an acute awareness of current culture that endears her to her audience. She has an intimate grasp of teenage struggles in an extremely online world because she herself has experienced them.

And though her lyrics tend towards self-deprecating at times, she is also perfectly capable of scathing criticism.";;
;;;"Generation Z are known as the “woke” generation because they are so socially and politically aware. They are not afraid to voice disapproval of public figures and brands that go against the principles they stand by, but they are also so willing to express support for those whose stances align with theirs.

During her debut Glastonbury performance in 2022, Olivia Rodrigo blasted the Supreme Court of the United States for overturning Roe v Wade, which previously legalized abortion in the U.S. She then dedicated her surprise performance of “F*** You” with Lily Allen to the Supreme Court justices involved in the decision.";;
;;;"So brands, creators, and influencers, if you want to remain in the good graces of the Gen Z audience, then you have to be well-versed in cultural goings-on. Be intentional about learning and responding to culture so as not to misstep.

When it matters to your customers,

When it is relevant on a local level, and

When it is simply the right thing to do.";;

Over the weeks, her tour outfits have naturally included Y2K styles from graphic tees to micro mini shorts and fish nets.

While enjoying a day off in Amsterdam, she temporarily transitioned away from her beloved pop-punk style to cottagecore cues.;;https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/olivia-rodrigo-goes-y2k-cottagecore-170140243.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJNx_09mmHBQBgno8nLQssyPR8000N0y2BTHxwPnjs5JDJX3Yv6XqSdqxAi6xms1CUOTjnycHnlyzbou0iYGUTzQKz_C5jAgCCH_9OAS1Fs8qC2Nk72FSUrZxul8cx2Go8QKEsUmOGdibSBfIf1yD4xYZdBkJ1Jr4ac6sNuXxT3X

A pastel pink cowboy hat that fittingly announced the arrival of the “Birthday Girl.” If you want to recreate Liv's look, you can get her skirt here and her oversleeve and camisole set here. London Calling, baby! Rodrigo landed on British soil with perhaps the most weather-appropriate ‘fit of all times. The singer kept warm and cozy with multiple layers and also took pattern and texture clashing to another level with the ’fit. While playing tourist in the English capital, the star donned a crocheted sweater, crocheted hat, a small bag on her shoulder, blue fishnet tights, and, of course, the OR staple: chunky shoes. (She is also wearing the Dasha Micro Skirt by Edikted under the layers.) The very definition of eclectic and we are loving every bit of it. (After all, you know what they say: When in Rome London…);;
;;;Yes, gorgeous, gorgeous girls are outfit repeaters — and, of course, Rodrigo is a gorgeous, gorgeous girl. On January 26, Rodrigo took to Instagram to share a few pics of the outfit she wore to Interscope’s 30th-anniversary exhibition at LACMA and we are spotting a familiar pair of boots. Yes, Rodrigo once again rocked the Marc Jacobs platform boots that once made her go viral, and, honestly, we love to see it. (The rest of her outfit, according to her stylists, is also from Marc Jacobs's Heaven line, which we know Liv loves.);;
;;;Rodrigo looked peak Olivia Rodrigo at the 2021 Teen Vogue Summit with a pair of Dr. Martens, of course. A big bow for Variety's Hitmakers event because she's a gift. (Her dress was Calvin Luo.). Another day, another YSL 'fit by Rodrigo. The star rocked a quintessential Saint Laurent look (black pointy pumps, black tights, and a tiny black dress) while attending Art Basel in Miami Beach with the brand. During the 2021 AMAs, Rodrigo looked stunning in her sequined and feathered periwinkle gown by David Koma. She paired the figure-hugging dress with some silver pumps that showed off her matching pedicure.

She paired the figure-hugging dress with some silver pumps that showed off her matching pedicure.;;
;;;On September 25, Rodrigo attended the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures opening gala in Los Angeles wearing this showstopping gown from Saint Laurent. She paired the look with a classic red lip and a simple but effective updo that also perfectly framed her face. While it is true that Rodrigo didn't look the most comfortable in this ensemble — maybe because the fit wasn't 100% perfect — the whole thing was stunningly gorgeous and it is, without a doubt, her most sophisticated look to date. If you ever wondered what Rodrigo's take on Parisian style would look like, wonder no more. While in Las Vegas, Rodrigo channeled her inner French gal (while letting her edgy side shine) with vintage Jean Paul Gaultier jeans, a crocheted beret, and a black corset bustier worn as a top. Her style inspiration for the look? None other than Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw. ;;
;;;For her MTV VMAs 2021 performance (and to receive her first Moon Person award), Rodrigo rocked this pastel dress from Marc Jacob's Heaven line. The purple and baby sky blue dress was custom-made for the artist. The collaboration makes total sense and works perfectly for Liv. She rounded off the look with a Swarovski choker, Wolford tights, and, of course, a pair of Dr. Martens x Heaven by Marc Jacobs croc boots. On the red carpet, Rodrigo wore this stunning Atelier Versace dress and archive Richard Kerr butterfly earrings.;;
;;;"By now, we all know Rodrigo has a penchant for platform boots, but she really took it to the next level with this Bratz-esque pair: the second Marc Jacobs pair in her arsenal (that we know of.)

Rodrigo stepped out in Los Angeles with Iris Apatow wearing a pair of the archive shoes, which were first unveiled during the Marc Jacobs Fall 2017 show. This silhouette, known as the Margaret, and her low-rise sister, the Ruth, have recently seen a spike in popularity as they are being sold once again at the Heaven by Marc Jacobs boutique in Los Angeles' Fairfax area.";;
;;;Rodrigo attended the launch party of Billie Eilish's new album, Happier Than Ever, in a stunning two-piece that she paired, of course, with Dr. Martens and silver jewelry. Rodrigo was spotted out and about in NYC, grabbing lunch and doing a bit of thrifting with Conan Gray in one of her most buzz-worthy outfits to date. The singer rocked a pair of white sunglasses, a graphic t-shirt from Mimi Wade, and a statement mini skirt. However, the stars of the outfit were without doubt her TikTok-approved Mayhem red patent platform boots from Naked Wolfe. (If “Oops!...I Did It Again” were a shoe, it'd be these.);;
;;;On July 14, Olivia Rodrigo arrived at the White House to promote COVID-19 vaccination among young people and she did so in an impeccable outfit. The star opted for a tweed Chanel two-piece and her trusty silver jewelry. To contrast the baby pink of the ensemble, she added a black mini purse and black socks paired with platform Mary Janes in white. A mix of Clueless's Cher Horowitz and Legally Blonde's Elle Woods, this outfit is more than perfect for the formal occasion. Rodrigo's current style lays at a mix of Gen-Z flare and early '00s grunge. This outfit is a perfect example of that: a DSQUARED2 red plaid print dress paired with Marc Jacobs knee-high platform heels with cutouts all the way up the front. Perfection;;
;;;"Performing her hit single ""Good 4 U"" for the first time on Saturday Night Live, Rodrigo went peak Gen-Z will her outfit: Plaid jumpsuit, Dr. Martens boots, and all the angst you could ask for. The look was a contrast from Rodrigo's previous outfit for the evening. While performing ""Drivers License,"" she donned a silk slip dress, matching the mood of the chart-topping tune. The juxtaposition between the two outfits showed Olivia Rodrigo's style range clearly, in just one evening. To promo her debut SNL performance, Rodrigo slipped into a shiny burgundy dress, cut at the mid-thigh but complete with sleeves. She paired it with a black face mask and threw her hair into two braids, which has since become one of her go-to 'dos.";;
;;;Rodrigo is not afraid to play with bold patterns and prints. Spotted on the streets of New York City leading up to her SNL debut performance, she sported a funky cat-print dress, worn on top of a black shirt. Rodrigo finished off the look with neon green sunglasses and black Converse low tops. Rodrigo showed up to her SNL rehearsal in this to die for ensemble: Beneath a classic leather jacket, Rodrigo opted for a two-piece neon green and black beaded set from Erika Maish. She completed the look with knee-high, lace-up boots. One word: Fabulous.;;
;;;For her first trip to London, Rodrigo did not disappoint on the fashion front. I mean, Marc Jacobs and Jean Paul Gaultier? Doesn’t get much more iconic! In her Hot Ones interview, Rodrigo admitted she loved this outfit so much she had to wear it twice in a row because she couldn’t secure a picture the first time. And we are glad she did!.

In her Hot Ones interview, Rodrigo admitted she loved this outfit so much she had to wear it twice in a row because she couldn’t secure a picture the first time. And we are glad she did!;;
;;;Prior to performing, Rodrigo walked the red carpet of the BRIT Awards in another Dior ensemble. Opting for another bold color, Olivia Rodrigo donned a strapless neon green tulle gown, paired with jewelry from Alexander Lee McQueen's right-hand man Shaun Leane. She completed the look with a simple, understated black belt and heels. It was classy yet flavorful, just as we've come to expect from Rodrigo. Sour? More like sweet, if you ask me! Rodrigo rocked this extravagant pink gown on Instagram, pairing it with some spiky neck jewelry to counteract its sweet vibe. Pattern clashing can be a big no for most of us, but Rodrigo pulls it off effortlessly. (And you can never go wrong with a pair of Vans slip-ons and matching socks!). This candid pic perfectly encapsulates Olivia Rodrigo's laid-back style. Dr. Martens Jadons, a pair of Y2k printed jeans, a graphic tee, and a leather jacket. Can you tell she's that girl?;;
;;;"Dr. Martens Jadons are a staple in Olivia Rodrigo's wardrobe, and she pairs them with everything, including polka-dot dresses. Rodrigo rang in 2021 in this stunning butterfly top with matching eye makeup. Converse, leather, and a layered sweater give Rodrigo's go-to look a preppier and winter-approved twist. Spotted in New York City, Olivia Rodrigo was serving some Cruella de Vil realness with this look: White furry coat with a red top, blue jeans, and matching red heels. Before her ""drivers license"" fame, there was no doubt Rodrigo was destined for greatness. At the Disney+ premiere of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, Olivia Rodrigowalked one of her first major red carpets, in style, of course. Stealing the spotlight with her over-the-top ensemble, Rodrigo went for a simple white t-shirt, paired with an eye-catching black tulle gown, finished with flower embellishes for a little pop of glamour. For an event in Hollywood, Rodrigo went the simple yet chic route, slipping into a pair of high-waisted trousers with a white t-shirt and a light-wash denim jacket. The look is mature but still matches her teenage glow.";;
;;;At the World Premiere of Disney's Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, Rodrigo looked, well, magical. This shimmery gold ensemble is fun and festive for the occasion, combining classic Disney energy with red carpet status. Rodrigo achieved peak cuteness at the D23 Disney Legends event, wearing a simple white turtleneck with burgundy suede pants. During this time, Olivia Rodrigo's style was simple yet perfectly curated. Still a young teenager, she never looked out of place. Rather, she was always put together, representing the classy woman she knew she'd become. While Rodrigo doesn't wear all-black 'fits too often anymore, she certainly did back in her early style days. This dress is fun, youthful and, while dark in color, it still finds a way to let her natural glow shine through. This pic is from a while ago, but Rodrigo looks just as mature as she does today. Attending the World Premiere of Disney and Pixar's Incredibles 2, Rodrigo wore a pair of high-waisted, green stain paints with a black and white polka-dot top. She paired the ensemble with some black heels and kept everything else simple. Rodrigo has never been one to overdue her looks, especially on the red carpet, and that's exactly why they work so well.;;
;;;In this printed black and red mini dress, Rodrigo looks like a Valentine's Day dream come true, even if she sported this particular ensemble in April. Rodrigo paired the dress with some darker eye makeup, heavier on the eyeliner and mascara than we've become accustomed to these days. Pretty in pink, this is one of the few pictures we have of the star with her hair up in a messy bun. Wearing all red, Rodrigo's baby face was on full display at the premiere of Coco. Matching this simple red dress with perfectly matching heels, Rodrigo showed how clean yet sophisticated her style was becoming. Another one of Rodrigo's rare, early all-black moments at the World Premiere of Marvel Studios' Thor: Ragnarok.;;
;;;This is years ago but Rodrigo looks just as put together as she does today. Simple and adorable, this dress matches her joyful persona perfectly. (And that hair!). Like many fellow Disney Channel stars, Rodrigo used her early teenage years to experiment with style, especially in 2017. At the premiere of Warner Bros. Pictures' Everything, Everything, she matched two very different prints together: a polka-dot top and a layered, striped skirt. As opposed to her current style, the look was a lot. But we love to see how far Rodrigo has grown, and which style choices led her to where she is today!. Another bold choice: This mix-matched ensemble for the PAWS FURR CAUSES Benefit for Lifelineforpets. And while that top may now be a bit outdated, there's no denying that Rodrigo could still rock that skirt today, and it would fit perfectly in with her current grunge-inspired closet.;;
;;;Throw on a leather jacket and some knee-high platform boots, and this is definitely a look Rodrigo could still pull off today. Baby Olivia Rodrigo! With her hair slicked back and makeup done bright and pretty, her youthful glow is shining through in this ensemble. While Rodrigo would likely never be caught dead wearing ripped jeans on the red carpet today, there was a time when she did. It's all a part of the evolutionary style journey!. From jeans to sophisticated in a flash, Rodrigo was showing her already developed diversity of style even in 2016. At the premiere of Finding Dory, Rodrigo paired this beautiful floral skirt with a simple black top. It's moments like these that show us how far her style has come, but also how authentic it has remained. That hair! Those shoes! The mix-matched denim! Baby Olivia Rodrigo was truly the cutest. Little did she know the journey that would lie ahead.;;
Prestige;21 November 2024;Mini braids made from a duplicate of sequined eyelids: How to master these Olivia Rodrigo-favorite beauty trends;"The Gen Z pop phenomenon Many Grammy Awards, a sold-out global tour, and singles like “Drivers License” that have broken many Spotify records are just a few of Olivia Rodrigo’s accomplishments. The 21-year-old’s star power also extends to the cosmetics industry, where her distinct grunge-inspired style has brought new trends into the fold and revitalized some timeless old ones. In terms of hair and makeup, the singer enjoys experimenting without going too far from her characteristic look, which is purple with dramatic red lips and a sharp cat eye. We showcase the distinctive and distinctive beauty trends ahead. Olivia Rodrigo: so thoughtful, yet so spoiled!

Like any other Gen Z, Olivia’s love for the ’90s is well-documented. Fishnet tights, butterfly accessories, slogan t-shirts that read “please don’t stay in touch”, all suggest her love for a period that existed before she was born. The singer draws on this Britney Spears-dominated era to create an aesthetic that straddles between grunge glamour and edgy minimalism. In doing so, Olivia Rodrigo has inspired cutesy beauty trends that are at odds with her songs of loss and heartbreak. Take a look at some of them below.";;https://www.prestigeonline.com/id/beauty-wellness/beauty/olivia-rodrigo-beauty-trends-2024/
;;;"Two slender braids on either side of the head are as Y2K as it gets. At a time when we are constantly chasing the clock, the simplicity of this hairstyle provides respite from those perfect blowouts that are hard to execute at home. The trick is simple: pull out a section from each side and make the easiest braid you know. Style the rest of your hair as you normally would. Or, you can leave your hair au naturel, allowing those tiny baby braids to pull focus. When you’re finished, use the trusted Honey Infused Hair Oil from Gisou to tame any flyaways. Known for adding texture and definition to any look, this hairstyle has gained traction among beauty enthusiasts like Bella Hadid, Hailey Bieber, and Kylie Jenner.

";;
;;;Thanks to her song “Vampire”, Olivia Rodrigo has settled quite comfortably into yet another TikTok beauty trend: Vampire skin. All you need is a flawless skin base, a highlighter of your liking, and blood-red lipstick to mimic this look. Bonus points if you can draw out a dramatic sharp liner as perfect as hers. Remember, glowing skin is the protagonist of this look so a dewy setting spray, preferably Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray by Charlotte Tilbury, will pack the right punch. As is evident from her music video, delicious cherry lips also add a sultry touch like no other. Swipe this NARS Powermatte Lip Pigment across your lips for a crimson red hue that is reminiscent of a “Godd–mn Vampire”.;;
;;;In an ode to her tried-and-true ‘clean girl’ aesthetic, Olivia Rodrigo’s 2021 Met Gala look featured dewy, scaled-back makeup that is super easy to recreate. Given her penchant for edgy vibes, the singer also added a touch of the viral graphic eye trend without straying away from ‘less is more’ territory. Make the look your own by creating a smooth canvas using YSL’s All Hours Foundation and Touche Eclat Pen. Then, take the Fenty Beauty Flyliner Liquid Eyeliner to draw pencil-thin lines along the inner corner and under your brow bone. Tie the entire look together with fluffed-up brows and elongated lashes. Olivia’s makeup artist Molly Greenwald recommends this YSL mascara for the perfect lash curl.;;
;;;Even when singing heartbreak anthems on stage, best believe that Olivia is still bejewelled — or, at least, her eyelids are. A fan of everything that dazzles and is purple, Rodrigo’s lilac lids sparkled like a disco ball at the GUTS world tour. To achieve a look like this one, start by priming your lids with Tom Ford Beauty’s Emotionproof Eye Primer. Then, apply a generous dose of your favourite lilac eyeshadow followed by Eternal Eye Bijou glitter from Jill Stuart. Finish off with Glossier’s smudge-resistant Pro Tip eyeliner to emulate her signature cat eye.;;
;;;"For her second-ever Met Gala, the pop grunge singer matched her Versace lavender gown with butterfly hair adornments perched atop tousled curls. Fashion a similar hairstyle with a pair of gorgeous butterfly clips. To add just the right amount of drama, try the floating crease eyeshadow trend as spotted on Olivia. And remember: All that glitters is not always gold; sometimes it’s purple.";;
;;;What’s better than cherry lips and sequinned eyelids? The two of them paired together. Try this gutsy makeup look that Olivia could not get enough of all through her GUTS World Tour.

Yahoo Entertainment;16 November 2024;Olivia Rodrigo Lets Her Y2K Gucci Thong and Pencil Skirt Do the Talking at the Billboard Live Music Summit;Olivia Rodrigo doesn't mind one bit if you can see her underwear. In fact, that was kind of the point of her outfit at the Billboard Live Music Summit in Los Angeles on Thursday. Before collecting her award for touring artist of the year, the pop star pulled up to the 1 Hotel in West Hollywood wearing a pitch-perfect Y2K look packed with covetable vintage designer finds.;;https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/olivia-rodrigo-lets-her-y2k-193811186.html
;;;The crown jewel of the ensemble was an icy blue low-rise pencil skirt with a small slit in the back from Gucci’s Spring/Summer 1998 collection designed by Tom Ford. With an indelible sheen akin to glistening snow, the same baby blue silk satin was also used to create a jacket and trousers for the collection. Underneath the skirt, Rodrigo flashed a glimpse of her black patent leather G-string thong with rhinestone logo buckles. Both the exposed thong and her strappy cropped black tank top come from Tom Ford's Spring/Summer 1998 collection for Gucci as well. The two pieces are generally sold as a set along with a black bodycon skirt, per Ford's original runway styling. But I like Rodrigo's colorful remixed version of the look—most likely styled by Chloe and Chenelle Delgadillo—quite a lot.;;
;;;"Rodrigo accessorized the ensemble with Amina Muaddi black satin Mary Jane pumps, Tiffany & Co. white diamond knot earrings, and a matching diamond-encrusted Tiffany Knot ring. Her nails were painted a punchy red for a pop of color that complemented her signature brownish red glossy lip. The rest of her glam was similarly classic with her long brunette hair styled in a sleek blowout and her eyes framed with black cat-eye liner. Rodrigo has been a Glossier ambassador for years, so her razor-thin flick was probably created using the brand's Pro Tip liquid eyeliner.

";;
;;;In a post-naked dressing trend world, almost nothing feels shocking anymore. Nudity is practically encouraged at red carpet events, and the trend has even wormed its way into the everyday closets of women whose job descriptions don't include being a pop star. That said, there remains something irresistibly fun and alluring about an exposed thong peeking out from a celebrity's waistline. It may not be risqué, but the G-string still knows how to command attention.;;
Cosmopolitan;31 Oktober 2024;"Olivia Rodrigo’s Red Hot Leather Dress Is Just Strips of Fabric Laced Together
Holding on by a single thread. ";It was Dua Lipa and Emily Ratajkowski who first put With Jéan on our radar. Similarly, Nicola Peltz Beckham and Raye introduced us to Peachy Den after wearing the London-based Y2K brand on repeat. And while we were already lusting after Charlotte Simone’s faux fur coats, Damson Madder, Charli XCX, and Anya Taylor-Joy’s respective backing only furthered our love for the labels.;;https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a62774229/olivia-rodrigo-red-lace-up-leather-dress/
;;;"Yep, the secret to identifying the next big designer name is really quite simple—it all comes down to celebrity support. So it should come as no surprise that Sabrina Carpenter, Kendall Jenner, and Dua have all been spotted recently repping Ludovic de Saint Sernin—aka the designer behind all the items currently sitting at the top of our imaginary wishlist. (Imaginary because, unfortunately for us, his collections sit a little outside our budgets.)

That won’t stop us from dreaming, though! And in our heads, we’re wearing the red hot leather lace-up dress from the designer’s SS25 collection, which Olivia Rodrigo legit just donned for an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.";;
;;;The musician’s appearance on October 29 saw the artist wearing the red patent leather mini. Complete with eyelets and lace-up detailing, two signifiers of Ludovic de Saint Sernin’s creations, the dress was essentially a long strip of fabric wound around her body and held together by a thread that also formed thin shoulder straps. With a plunging sweetheart neckline and additional lace-up detailing across the bust, it gave high glamour rock and roll.;;
;;;In addition to crafting all of Sabrina Carpenter’s custom costumes for Act III of the Short n’ Sweet Tour, the designer is *also* behind Dua’s recent bandana top and lace-up trousers ‘fit, which echoes the design features in Olivia’s latest look.;;
Harper's Bazar;23 Oktober 2025;"Olivia Rodrigo on Making New Music, Choosing an Album Title, and Finding Inspiration
The pop princess talks with Harper’s Bazaar about what she’s been up to since the end of the Guts Tour";"Even someone like Olivia Rodrigo—Grammy winner, record breaker, and certified hitmaker—can still get nervous about being onstage.

Three months after the conclusion of the worldwide Guts Tour, the pop princess is getting ready to headline yet another event. Except this time, she’ll be swapping sold-out arenas for an intimate venue in New York City.

“I’m a little nervous,” Rodrigo tells Harper’s Bazaar a day before the show, which marks her first live performance since the end of her tour. “I hope I’m not too rusty.”";;https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a69134654/olivia-rodrigo-american-express-new-music-interview-2025/
;;;Even with just two albums under her belt, Rodrigo is no stranger to crafting songs that instantly go multiplatinum. But for her one-night-only event, she’s focusing on a different kind of platinum. As she teased to fans on social media earlier this week, the singer partnered with American Express for the exclusive show, which will highlight expanded benefits to the bank’s Platinum card members. One hundred percent of the proceeds from the show’s ticket sales will go toward Fund 4 Good, a nonprofit Rodrigo launched in 2023 to support women’s equity across the globe. Through Fund 4 Good, Rodrigo has supported the National Network of Abortion Funds, Women’s Shelters Canada, Women Against Violence Europe, and more.;;
;;;A day before Rodrigo’s return to the stage, she hopped on the phone with Harper’s Bazaar to talk about getting back in the studio, brainstorming album names, and finding musical inspiration.;;
;;;I honestly feel like I’ve just gotten back to normal recently, and I finished three months ago, which is kind of crazy. But, yeah, it’s a lot on your body and on your mind to just be traveling all over the world for months and months on end. To be experiencing that kind of energetic rush at the end of the day, it really kind of changes your brain chemistry a little bit—in a good way and maybe also in not a good way sometimes. It’s taken me some time, but I’m really settling back into normal L.A. life and music-making life, so, yeah, it’s been good. Thanks for asking.;;
;;;I love being creative. It’s truly my favorite thing. Touring is wonderful, and everything else about my job is really great, but being able to write and have a feeling in your brain and an idea and be able to flesh it out and make it into something that can exist in the real world is just such a wonderful, euphoric, addicting feeling. I’m having a good time in the studio and having fun and playing around. It’s been really enjoyable.;;
;;;"Honestly, being at home. That’s really boring to say, but when I’m on the road, your brain is kind of so scattered, and there’s so many things going on that it’s kind of hard to really center yourself and dig deep. But being at home for a while, it’s been really great. I always come up with ideas in the car, oddly, like driving around. In L.A., I’m driving around a lot, so that’s convenient. I always come up with a lot of ideas just on the freeway.

I’m also from L.A., so I get that. Something about that rush-hour traffic, and then you’ve got the sunset with the palm trees.
Totally. And there’s nothing you can do. You just sit there. You can’t go on your phone or anything because your brain’s just working. It’s good for you. Yeah.";;
;;;"Can you describe what an ideal day in the studio looks like to you?
I usually get there around noon. I’ve been working with my producer, and he’s one of my best friends, so we kind of just shoot the shit for an hour and talk about what’s going on or talk about the thing that we read online or something, and then maybe we write a song for an hour or two and take lunch. We’ve been making these really delicious turkey sandwiches with brie and arugula, and I’ve been looking forward to it. Every day I wake up and I’m so excited to eat this sandwich. So probably something like that, and then, I don’t know, work a little more and go home and hopefully have made something listenable that day.";;
;;;"When you’re working on a new album, do you tend to think of a title before you start working on new music, or do you write music first and then the music refines the angle of what you want the title to be?
I had the title of Guts and Sour at the beginning of the album-making process, but for this album, I’m kind of still finding it right now. I have a few options that are twirling around in my brain. I have one that I’m feeling good about, and I think that’ll be the title, but I am not 100 percent positive yet. I’m not writing it in stone quite yet.";;
;;;"Is deciding on a title a gut reaction to you? No pun intended.
Yeah. I think that it has to feel right in your body. I have to sleep on it a few nights before I really decide that that’s the one.

Going back to the Guts Tour really quick, there were so many fun details for the tour. We have that camera under the plexiglass during “Obsessed” and the flying moon during “Enough for You.” I was wondering if there were any ideas you had for the tour that you ultimately ended up not doing?
Oh, man. In the arena tour, we had this moon that was flying around the arena, and initially I was supposed to stand on the moon and play guitar while it went all around, and I thought that the idea was really cool. Then once I saw the moon and saw how high up I was going to be, I was like, “Heck no. Oh my God, I can’t do that.” I was so afraid, but maybe in another world I would’ve been standing on the moon playing guitar and it would’ve looked really cool.";;
;;;"Tomorrow’s concert with American Express, will that be your first time back on stage since the Guts Tour ended?
I think it will be, which is exciting. I’m a little nervous. I hope I’m not too rusty.

Obviously, the vibe will be a little different from the sold-out arenas you played on tour. This one is a more intimate venue. Does that change your mentality or preparation as a performer?
Yeah, I think that it definitely does. I think it changes the way that I approach the songs. I want to do something that’s a little more pared back and intimate because I think that this venue probably lends itself more to that, which is really exciting to me. I haven’t done that in a really long time, so it’s going to be a fun new adventure for me and my band.";;
;;;"Are you bringing back the same band from the Guts Tour?
Yeah, which will be really great. I love those girls so much. It’s been nice to get to hang with them in New York a little bit.";;
;;;"What did you learn about yourself while touring?
Oh my goodness. I learned so much. Touring is so, so hard. I had to take care of my body and myself in a way that I’d never had to before. I was just super careful about exercising and eating all the right foods and making sure I felt nourished and making sure I got enough sleep. I feel like I really had to kind of be an adult and take care of myself for the first time in a while, so I learned a lot about that. But, I mean, the list goes on. It was a very challenging and very rewarding process, both just as a person and as an artist, and so I look back at those times very fondly.";;
;;;"Since you’re working with American Express for tomorrow’s show, I was curious to know if you could share the last thing you bought on your AmEx Platinum card.
It’s so funny. The other day—I have a pointed memory. I have the mirrored card now, the Platinum mirrored card, and I was with my friend and we parked and I was trying to pay the parking meter, and I took out my mirrored Platinum card and they were like, “Whoa. That’s so fancy and cool looking.” And I was like, “Yeah, it’s my AmEx card.” I was like, wow, I wish someone was filming it. It’d be the perfect little AmEx commercial, because it just does look really cool.";;
Something Curated;26 Februari 2025;Paris Hilton’s Archive Sale and the Growing Number of Celebrities Selling Clothes Online;‘Walk, don’t run’ might have been the caption announcing Paris Hilton’s archive sale earlier this month. Set up to raise money for those effected by the fires in LA earlier this year, Hilton sold off 97 pieces. The sale was on Vestiaire Collective but, with items made of Y2K dreams, it would have been the envy of any Depop girlie. See complete Juicy couture tracksuits, a Takashi Murakami x Louis Vuitton handbag and pair of MCM shades to relive any A Simple Life fantasies. It’s no wonder that the items swiftly sold out.;;https://somethingcurated.com/2025/02/26/paris-hilton-paul-mescal-olivia-rodrigo-depop-vinted/
;;;"If Hilton’s sale was bookmarked by those interested in acquiring a piece of recent fashion history, it fits into a wider trend of celebrities selling their clothes, and the rest of us rushing to buy them. Paul Mescal sold some pieces from his wardrobe on Vinted last year – including some of those trademark cardigans – to raise money for Pieta, a suicide prevention charity. As The Guardian wrote at the time, “It is unconfirmed whether the clothes have been washed since the actor last wore them.” Kim Gordon, the Sonic Youth front woman hosted one in LA in 2023 where fans queued up from 6am for the chance to buy her old cast-offs, possibly with added lore. “That has stains,” said her stylist Christina Turner, to the LA Times, about a hoodie. “It went through the grunge era.”

";;
;;;The most high profile sale recently was that of Chloe Sevigny, the actor who has managed to remain a style icon for 30 years. Organised by Liana Satenstein, who has made a business doing closet sales under the title of Neverworns, this 2023 event was titled ‘Sale of the Century’ and was treated as such by the general public, with queues snaking around the block in Manhattan. Satenstein described the queue as “a human centipede” to the New York Times. ;;
;;;It’s not just regular joes, either. Sophie Thatcher, the actor who stars in TV series Yellow Jackets, queued for Gordon’’s, buying a J Crew sweater and Bella Freud dress. Olivia Rodrigo shopped the Sevigny sale. She was later photographed in a checked Versace mini dress that she described as “my most prized possession”. The full circle moment? Fans buying Rodrigo’s own cast-offs, which she uploads semi-regularly on her Depop shop.;;
;;;"If we’re all buying more secondhand clothes – the market is forecast to reach $350 billion by 2028, according to Thredup – and scrolls on Vinted, eBay and Depop are increasingly part of our screen time every day, a celebrity archive sale is something different. This is a piece of history and an addition to your wardrobe – a combination that even other stars are not immune to.

As the internet allows more of us to become increasingly fashion-literate – and the likes of Zendaya, Kendall Jenner and Miley Cyrus wear rare deep cuts by designers like Thierry Mugler and Bob Mackie on the red carpet — it may be that queues begin to form for sales beyond the top line celebrities. Satenstein’s Neverworns has also organised closet sales for highly-rated fashion editors including Lynn Jaeger and Sally Singer from Vogue, writing on Instagram about their “decades of stuff”, ranging from eighties Claude Montana to brands shortened to their fashion nicknames (“Comme, Dries”). The comments are stuffed full of hearts-for-eyes emojis.";;
;;;The irl nature of Satenstein’s sales are part of their success – they’re a hang out, and a place to be seen. And, in this era of fashion geekery, that’s a factor for archive sales even without the clothes having a connection to an auspicious previous owner. Dazed named Second Life, the archive market in Dalston, as the place where you’ll find London’s best street style recently, thanks to twentysomethings wrapped in beanies and brown to get their hands on pieces by labels like Miu Miu and Jil Sander at (somewhat) cheaper prices. Your bank balance might not thank you for attending but you’ll be in good company and – ultimately – much better dressed wearing other people’s clothes. ;;
Yahoo Life;11 April 2024;Kaia Gerber Outfits: Her Y2K-Coded Olivia Rodrigo Concert Look;Kaia Gerber has mastered the art of model-off-duty style. Her wardrobe is packed with timeless staples—with a few fun pieces thrown in. And that combination leaves all of Kaia Gerber’s outfits looking effortlessly stylish. She pulls off bucket hats, blazers, and breezy dresses with ease, throwing together outfits chic enough to bookmark and save for later. If there’s an intimidating trend you’re interested in trying, Kaia Gerber’s street style looks are the perfect place to turn for inspiration. She’s probably already worn in, showing us all how to style it with basics we already have in our closets.;;https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/kaia-gerber-brought-back-2-174225834.html
;;;Case in point? Kaia Gerber showed up to Olivia Rodrigo’s Guts Tour in New York City wearing two controversial Y2K trends we never thought we’d see again. In true Kaia Gerber fashion, she pulled both off and made the once-regrettable 2000s style choices look refined and expensive. Seeing Kaia flawlessly experiment with these trends makes us want to dust off our favorite aughts accessories. Any outfit she wears screams downtown cool girl, and this look is proof that even when trying out daring trends, Kaia manages to maintain her signature minimalist style.;;
;;;We shouldn’t be surprised. The fact of the matter is, Kaia has a way of making the most basic pieces—and the most bizarre ones—look fashion-week-ready. The model knows that finding good staple pieces is the key to having a versatile yet stylish wardrobe. Paired with the right essentials, even the most unexpected pieces can look cool.;;
;;;While we all questioned whether wearing a belt over a shirt was a valid fashion decision, Kaia Gerber has shown us yet again how to make it look tasteful and expensive. And she didn’t stop there. She paired her chunky studded belt with an off-the-shoulder, long-sleeve tunic with finger holes—resurrecting two Y2K trends we buried a long time ago.;;
;;;Low-waisted pants have been a huge trend recently, so long shirts were also overdue for a comeback. And with the belt worn over her shirt, Kaia’s look is very Y2K-coded. Although the model usually wears ’90s-inspired staples, she managed to make these risky 2000s trends look chic. And her Olivia Rodrigo concert outfit has managed to make us seriously nostalgic for noughties fashion (in a good way). Kaia’s eclipse-viewing outfit is a classic example of her classic style. Her kitten heels, midi skirt, and long sleeve crop top could’ve very well walked out of a 90s romcom. Leave it to her to look so effortlessly stylish while wearing eclipse glasses.;Low-waisted pants have been a huge trend recently, so long shirts were also overdue for a comeback.

New York Times;25 Oktober 2025;"Y2K Kids Were the Last to Really Rage With No One Watching
The angst of nu metal is being discovered by Gen Z, but with digital eyes always looming, the ephemeral catharsis of collectively going mad is a thing of the past.";"When I stumbled out of my first concert in the spring of 1998, I couldn’t even hold up my head. My 17-year-old ears were buzzing and a trickle of blood ran down the side of my neck from a hoop earring that had been ripped out in the mosh pit where I had left every last scrap of my adolescent rage. Just months after the release of their defining album “Around the Fur,” I was already infatuated with the California nu metal band Deftones.

My mother picked me up from the Louisville brewery where they’d performed, two hours from the Kentucky town where I grew up. She was understandably shocked at the sight of me — and let me know it — but I couldn’t hear a word she said as we drove off.";;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/arts/music/korn-nu-metal-rock-y2k.html
;;;As a fan of many nu metal, alt metal and industrial bands that reigned at the time — particularly Korn, Deftones, Nine Inch Nails, Tool and Rage Against the Machine — I’d go on to reclaim that sensation over the next few years. I felt baptized in the highly emotional music that candidly examined themes of misery, loss and alienation, feelings expressed in urgent vocals, guttural sounds, screams and growls.;;
;;;"It’s easy to forget how popular this sound was. Freaks ruled, and not just figuratively. Korn were bona fide rock stars: “Follow the Leader,” their third album, debuted at No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 in 1998, selling about 270,000 copies in its opening week; “Issues,” in 1999, also debuted at No. 1, selling nearly 575,000 copies in its first week and keeping both Dr. Dre and Celine Dion out of the top spot. As of 2021, the band had sold more than 40 million albums globally.";;
;;;"But I’m not trying to nostalgia farm and wax poetic, I swear. Nor am I here to defend, dissect or take down the toxic dynamics inherent to the nu metal scene. The lyrics were often obscene and nihilistic, and the energy frequently tipped toward anarchy. As a young woman enmeshed in the dude-heavy environment, you don’t need to tell me. We can also probably agree that most Y2K pop culture touchstones had a very dark side.

This instead is an ode to a realization that those of us who came of age in that moment were the last wave of disaffected youth to have something we didn’t even know we had, something we were all about to lose: the ability to express ourselves freely in public without the ever-looming specter of perpetual surveillance, digital documentation and social-media receipts. When we raged, we never considered that we were being watched, because we weren’t.";"But I’m not trying to nostalgia farm and wax poetic, I swear.

When we raged, we never considered that we were being watched, because we weren’t.";
;;;We were there for the moment. We went all out. We were cringe. We were free, even when it was ugly. There were no screens to break, only lit cigarettes to dodge. These days, loneliness and isolation are epidemics, in no small part because of technology. We regularly mourn our shift away from what’s “real.” Usually this thinking is applied to the feel-good aspects of the good ol’ days: family dinners, going to movie theaters, simply hanging out in person.;;
;;;"But I can’t help but remember when rage was a collective act, when cavernous internal loneliness wasn’t a reason to disengage from the world physically. At their best, these shows were a channel for camaraderie through rebellion, a place to exorcise real-world dismay through art and metaphor.

It’s an outlet that prior generations also enjoyed, whether in the hardcore punk and metal scenes of the 1970s and 1980s, or the hip-hop and grunge scenes of the 1990s, before winding down shortly after nu metal’s heyday and the rise of photo-forward social media, particularly Myspace in 2003.";;
;;;"In Korn’s hit “Blind,” off the group’s self-titled debut album in 1994, the lead singer Jonathan Davis feverishly repeats: “I can see, I can see I’m going blind.” The lyric conveys the awareness of an inflection point and of an impending loss; the desperation of straddling two states of being; of having something critical and having little say as it slips away.

Today, we’re steeped in rage, which always finds a release. But like many once-shared experiences, it has often become a private act demonstrated primarily from behind a keyboard, whether in texts between individuals or public comments posted online.";;
;;;When rage does emerge en masse now, it’s almost always through a political lens. And it comes with the acceptance that your face and identity may be captured, and even used against you. That stands in great contrast to a time when adolescent rage could be a fitful state of confusion without a clear point of view or a digital shadow.;;
;;;Nu metal fell out of the mainstream relatively quickly (with Woodstock 99 hastening its collapse), then rock music started disappearing from the charts altogether. But with Gen Z’s interest in the “before times” swelling, a revival is afoot. It’s evident in fashion trends including oversize JNCO-type jeans, and in the demand for tangible media like vinyl records and CDs. Korn headlined Lollapalooza in August, sharing top billing with Olivia Rodrigo.;;
;;;"Korn filled stadiums on tour with System of a Down this summer. And it was announced this week that these two bands, along with Deftones, will serve as headliners for next year’s Sick New World festival celebrating the music of that era at two huge shows in Las Vegas and Texas. You don’t need Billie Eilish wearing a Korn shirt onstage to signal a nu metal renaissance, but it doesn’t hurt.

Just see Lola Young’s video for “Conceited” — a Y2K-era vision, complete with electric guitar riffs and a headbanging scene with not an iPhone in sight. It suggests a sort of dreamscape: Gen Zers surrounded by darkness, eyes closed, present in their bodies in a crowd pulsating with human emotion, no one reaching for their digital escape pod.";;
;;;"Of course, some artists have started banning phones in their crowds in recent years. Often this is for copyright reasons or to stem low-quality recordings from proliferating, but other times it’s to foster what once was. “I want people to live in the moment, and it’s funny that the easiest way to rebel is to tell people to turn off their phone,” the rock star Jack White said in 2018. “If your phone is that important to you that you can’t live without it for two hours then, I don’t know, maybe it’s time to see a therapist.”

It would indeed take a psychological reboot to restore that type of liberation, even if all security cameras are toggled off and all phones are left at the door. The itch of the digital phantom limb is now hard-wired.";;
;;;"It’s a reality we didn’t outright opt into, but one we can’t easily opt out of.

Videos of System of a Down playing its 2001 hit “Chop Suey!” live in 2002 at the Rock im Park festival in Germany have millions of views on YouTube. When the music drops, the sea of concertgoers erupts in emotion and undulates with movement, fists up, not one gripping a phone.";;
;;;"Stadium in New Jersey reveal tens of thousands of fists up, but now they create a sea of lit rectangles. And the bodies? Standing predicably still so as not to jostle the recordings.

A correction was made on Oct. 28, 2025: An earlier version of this article misstated the chronology of Korn’s albums. “Follow the Leader” was the band’s third album, not its sophomore album.

Screen Rent;7 April 2025;Who's The Biggest Pop Princess In Today's Music World? Here Are The 8 Best Candidates;"The term ""pop princess"" encapsulates fresh, teen-driven contemporary pop music. Past crown holders have included Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna. While, historically, the term has referred to essentially only US-based artists, in the current music industry, there are many contenders across the globe.

While no one has better embodied the term since Britney Spears’ run in the Y2K era, there are many young ladies in the pop scene today that could surpass the icon. The pandemic and global lockdown forced the music industry to pivot. Online streaming, music video consumption on YouTube, and the surge in social media interactivity permitted new artists to rise to the top ranks of the pop music world.";;https://screenrant.com/modern-pop-princess-list/

All of them hold global appeal with room for growth, despite being big award winners and achieving record-breaking sales.;;

The Whirlwind Commercial Success In The US
Olivia Rodrigo has been immersed in a music career that seems to outdo itself with every new release. With early beginnings on Disney Channel in shows such as Bizaardvark and Disney+'s High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, Rodrigo hasn’t exactly followed the typical Disney starlet blueprint. She left Disney in 2019 and signed with Geffen Records to better focus on her solo career.

With her debut single “driver’s license,” she broke Spotify’s record for most daily streams (for a non-holiday song) twice, reaching 17 million global streams. She would go on to end her monumental first year as a solo artist with Billboard confirming she was the bestselling singles artist worldwide – on top of winning three Grammys.";;
;;;Rodrigo embodies a spirit-of-change by simultaneously being pop-culture centric and advocating for others, despite having only two solo albums in her catalog. The musical direction Rodrigo has adapted, a pop-rock-focused femininity, has allowed her to be relatable to her predominantly teenage audience. Her strong voice and humble lyrical perspectives are her special sauce, fostering excitement for the future of her career.;;

Medium;14 Desember 2024;Y2K Nostalgia: Why 2000s Trends are Making a Comeback;"The 2000s left an impactful mark on technology and culture that continues to influence us today. This era — filled with velour tracksuits, flip phones, and pop-punk anthems — is making a comeback with a modern flair. But why are these Y2K trends making such a bold return?

While past trends are known for cycling back into the mainstream, technology has significantly impacted how quickly they come and go. Plus, the trials we face today have us yearning for times when life felt simpler and safer.

This accelerated return is not just a coincidence and can be directly linked to the unique circumstances of recent years. A shift in how we consume media and a collective desire for comfort and familiarity have brought these trends back into the spotlight. The resurgence of fashion, music, and technology trends from the 2000s can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, movies and television shows on streaming services, and influencers on social media.";;https://medium.com/fall-2024-icm506-writing-for-interactive-media/y2k-nostalgia-why-2000s-trends-are-making-a-comeback-a9c08232c21a
;;;"The Whys Behind This Y2K Revival
Fashion and cultural trends have long followed a 20-year cycle. This theory was first proposed in the 1930s by English museum curator James Laver. Laver’s Law predicts when trends will start to become acceptable again–after about 20 years. So while the 2020s are influenced by the 2000s, the 2000s had influences from the 1980s and the 1960s, as the trends roll back around every 20 years. The fashion industry relies on this theory to dictate what’s in and what’s out, and predict what they should sell.

So, it was inevitable that 2000s trends would return in the 2020s. But certain forces have made this return feel especially rapid, and it seems that we may already be moving on in some ways.";;

Series like The O.C. and One Tree Hill and movies such as Mean Girls and 13 Going on 30 have reignited interest in the fashion, slang, and pop culture of the time.

Social media is probably the most affluent driving force behind the rapid resurgence of 2000s trends. TikTok has especially made an impact as a platform with viral challenges, sounds, and fashion aesthetics inspired by the early 2000s. Users often recreate iconic fashion looks and use throwback songs in their content, allowing generations to relive or be introduced to iconic trends from the Y2K era.

Influencers and celebrities also have the power to be trendsetters. Celebrities like Hailey Bieber, Bella Hadid, and Kendall Jenner have embraced 2000s fashion, making it cool again. Social media influencers followed in these celebrities’ footsteps, which then brought it to the public. This proves the power of the modern-day influencer on our society.";;

;;;"Fashion
The revival of 2000s fashion is impossible to miss, with iconic staples reemerging in everyday wardrobes. But people are taking these trends and putting their own modern twist on them, depending on their personal style.

Low-rise jeans, a once controversial trend, have made a return. People have realized that different styles look better on different body types and are glad that low-rise options are more readily available today. Accessories have also seen a Y2K resurgence. Platform shoes, trucker hats, and small shoulder bags are making their way into the mainstream again.

Many of these fashion trends can be attributed to the rewatching and rebooting of movies and television shows, as explained earlier. These pieces of media showcase these trends and reinforce their appeal to a younger audience. For example, Marissa Cooper (played by Mischa Barton) from the show The O.C. is often seen wearing low-rise jeans, cropped graphic tees, and halter tops.";;
;;;"Celebrities also have a major influence on these fashion trends. Bella Hadid is credited with “the great UGG renaissance,” as she was spotted wearing platform UGG boots. Paparazzi photos spread like wildfire and the shoes immediately sold out.

Thrifting and secondhand shopping have been on the rise as people are becoming more environmentally and economically conscious. People experience a thrill when they find a unique item or something they used to wear when they were younger that brings back memories. They take these vintage pieces and incorporate them into their style in a more modern way.

;;;"Music
The resurgence of 2000s music trends has been one of the most vibrant aspects of the Y2K revival. TikTok and artists like Olivia Rodrigo have had major influences on this revival.";;
;;;"On TikTok, people have been rediscovering old songs and using them as background music in their videos. Creators also choreograph dances to these songs that may end up going viral. An example of a song that started trending again is Aly & AJ’s “Potential Breakup Song.” After this song went viral on TikTok, the sister duo got back together and re-recorded an explicit version.

Olivia Rodrigo is one of the most prominent young artists today who is at the forefront of reviving the 2000s pop-punk and emo sound. Her music, particularly hits like “good 4 u” and “brutal,” channels the angst and energy of the early 2000s with a fresh and modern perspective. The “good 4 u” music video also references iconic 2000s films including Jennifer’s Body and The Princess Diaries. Rodrigo has openly cited inspiration from artists like Hayley Williams (Paramore) and Avril Lavigne, bringing the genre into the modern age for a new generation of fans.";;

At the time, 2000s technology seemed so novel and futuristic, it’s crazy to think how much things have changed since then. But now, devices such as flip phones and digital cameras are making a modern comeback with younger generations. These devices were once seen as peak technology and are now being utilized for their simplicity and charm.

Flip phones are making a surprising return, as many people find themselves so addicted to their smartphones. Many young people are choosing to embrace this digital detox and unplug from the constant notifications and temptations of social media. There is also something very satisfying about being able to flip the phone shut dramatically like they do in the movies. According to ZDNet, searches for flip phones have increased by over 15,000% over the past year among Gen-Z and younger Millennials.";;
;;;"Influencers on TikTok have shared their experiences switching to these devices. TikTok influencer Sammy Palazzolo is a college student who shares how she exclusively takes a flip phone when she goes out at night with her friends. She says that it eliminates “drunk texts” and the urge to check social media, helping her to live more in the moment.

Digital and disposable film cameras have also made a comeback, coinciding with social media presence. With disposable film cameras, people get to take photos without immediately being able to look at them. This lets us live more authentically, as we are not as worried about how we look. There are even apps, such as Dispo, that allow you to get the effect of a disposable camera right on your phone. This app does not let you look at the photos for 24 hours and puts a filter on them to make it feel like it was taken on a disposable camera.";;
;;;On the flipside, digital cameras are having a revival as people like the high-quality photos they produce. This can help people grow their social media presence, as many people strive to be considered an “influencer.” Flash photography is also having a moment, and these digital cameras deliver on that end.;;
;;;"How Long Will This Y2K Cycle Last?
With social media, trends are coming and going at an incredibly rapid pace. The overexposure of them is causing us to move on quickly to something else. With the availability of almost anything at our fingertips, people are also embracing individuality by combining certain subcultures with their own identities and creating their own microtrends. People are remixing old trends with modern influences and creating personal styles that transcend any single era. And I think there is something beautiful in that — having access to so much of the past and being able to relive it in your own way.";;

;;;"Meanwhile, everyone wears everything, and multiple styles are often blended until the references become almost impossible to trace. From Y2K to e-girl, from the clean girl hype to dark academia and everything in between, Gen Z is a mosaic of interests, passions, and identities that defy a single ‘aesthetic.’

Born between 1997 and 2012, Gen Z has grown up in a world of rapid technological advancement, cultural shift, call for equality and global connectivity. A generation raised on the internet doesn’t follow a single set of rules. They curate their identities in real time, drawing inspiration from various subcultures, eras, and online communities. Gen Z isn’t just consuming trends—they’re the ones setting and remixing them. And just when you think you’ve caught their vibe, they’ve already moved on to something you haven’t even heard of yet.";;
;;;"Breaking the Myth of a Monolithic ‘Aesthetic’
It’s tempting to define generations by dominant trends and put them into tiny and neat organized boxes, especially for the creative industry. For Gen Z, the media often highlights styles like ‘e-girl’ or ‘cottagecore,’ suggesting a uniform way of self-expression.

However, the idea that Gen Z follows just one aesthetic at a time is not only wrong—it’s lazy. If anything, Gen Z is a patchwork of micro-trends, each with its own mood, vibe, and following.";;
;;;"1. Cottagecore: The Pastoral Dream
Cottagecore romanticizes rural life, emphasizing simplicity, nature, and a return to traditional crafts. Think soft linen dresses, homemade bread, and cozy countryside aesthetics. This trend is partly a reaction against the fast-paced digital world, offering a sweet escape.

;;;"2. Goblincore: Finding Beauty in the Unconventional
Goblincore embraces the overlooked and imperfect aspects of nature: mushrooms, frogs, and the allure of the forest floor. It aligns with sustainable values, often promoting thrifted fashion and second-hand finds.

?? Podcast Recommendation: Marketing to Gen Z by Brand Innovators discusses how brands tap into these niche aesthetics.";;
;;;"3. E-Boys and E-Girls: The Digital Alternative Scene
Rooted in platforms like TikTok, E-Boys and E-Girls borrow elements from emo, punk, and anime culture. With bold makeup, layered outfits, and chain accessories, their aesthetic is a modern twist on alternative styles.

4. Dark Academia: The Romanticization of Knowledge
Dark Academia draws inspiration from classic literature, ancient art, and the pursuit of knowledge. It romanticizes learning and the arts, encouraging introspection and a deeper appreciation for intellectual pursuits.

5. Clean Girl Aesthetic: Minimalism and Wellness
A newer trend, the ""clean girl aesthetic"" revolves around minimalistic make-up (“no make-up make-up”), skincare routines, pastel nails (think of the “glazed donut” nail trend, firstly initiated by Hailey Bieber… don’t quote me on that though) and effortlessly sleek outfits. It represents an idealized version of self-care and productivity.";;
;;;"6. Clowncore: The Playful and Chaotic Subculture
Clowncore embraces exaggerated fashion, bright colors and theatrical accessories. This aesthetic represents a sense of rebellion against perfectionism, highlighting humor and bold self-expression.

Gorpcore: Fashion Meets Functionality
Named after “Good Ol’ Raisins and Peanuts” (a reference to trail mix), gorpcore is all about practical, outdoor-inspired looks. Think Arc’teryx fleeces, hiking boots, and oversized puffer jackets. It blends utility with streetwear, proving you don’t have to be climbing mountains to dress like you are.

4. Coquette: Hyper-Feminine Meets Edgy
Lace, bows, ballet flats, and pearls—paired with a knowing, almost ironic attitude. The coquette aesthetic pulls from vintage romance, mixing softness with subversiveness. Sabrina Carpenter or Olivia Rodrigo are current examples for that.";;
;;;"5. Cybercore: The Digital Future
Neon, techwear, digital landscapes, and metallic aesthetics. Cybercore takes inspiration from the internet itself, blending elements of futurism and virtual escapism.

But that’s barely the tip of the iceberg. The best part? These aesthetics aren’t set in stone. Gen Z is pulling from multiple trends, creating new ones and morphing them into their own unique style.";;
;;;"The “Other” Side
That said, this fluidity exists alongside a growing wave of conservative youth, particularly in the U.S. While many Gen Zers embrace progressive ideals, there is a significant counter-movement of young conservatives, fueled by online spaces like Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok. Young Trump supporters, rich white conservative men, and reactionary influencers are carving out their own version of Gen Z identity—one that stands in stark contrast to the more progressive, gender-inclusive, and socially aware segments of the generation. This trend is also swapping over to europe.

For every gender-fluid TikTok influencer, there’s a viral clip of a young conservative pushing back against LGBTQ+ rights, racial justice, or progressive policies. This cultural clash within Gen Z is becoming more apparent, highlighting that the generation isn’t just a monolith of inclusivity and leftist ideals—it’s also producing outspoken reactionaries who reject the very changes their peers already have accomplished.";;
;;;"The overturning of Roe v. Wade didn’t just roll back federal abortion rights—it handed the power to individual states, leading to bans and severe restrictions in much of the country. At the same time, the backlash against DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives is gaining momentum, further fueling concerns about civil rights regression. It’s a stark reminder that progress is never guaranteed and that pushback is just as real as the progress itself.

The result? A generation that is both: incredibly accepting and deeply divided at the same time, showing that Gen Z isn’t heading in just one direction—it’s splintering into many.";;
The Science Survey;10 Juli 2024;"How TikTok is Bringing Back the Early 2000s
Social media plays a huge role in reviving the Y2K aesthetic. What is it, and why is it happening?";"You look through the crowd of students waiting to enter the school building each morning, or those rushing down the hallway to their next class after the bell rings, or simply a group of teens passing you by on the sidewalk. Everyone is seemingly dressed to the “lounge” aesthetic. You’ve seen it, haven’t you? The Crocs, plaid pajama pants, and oversized hoodies or t-shirts. 

Trends are constantly changing, especially in the digital age with social media influencers. What used to take years for a trend to fade out can now take a few months or sometimes weeks. It’s a constant cycle of specific styles, items, or brands being introduced to us. We’re pressured to buy the latest thing, only to discard it a few months down the road as new trends pop up. This constant state of consumerism is driven by trends’ being a source of social acceptance. You fit in when you have what everyone else has. Once those trends change, you follow because you want to belong. ";;https://thesciencesurvey.com/arts-entertainment/2024/07/10/how-tiktok-is-bringing-back-the-early-2000s/
;;;"Recently, one of these trends is the Y2K style, which consists of the late 1990s to mid 2000s. The shift from modern skinny jeans and high-rise pants to old low-rise jeans, baggy pants, claw clips, and streetwear shows how fashion styles often go back to a previous decade. As someone who was a teenager in the 1990s growing up in Manhattan, my mom often goes on long tangents about how she used to wear clothes that looked exactly like the ones I have. “Everything comes back. I should have kept all my old clothes for you,” she says.

Among all the social media platforms that promote these various trends, TikTok is one of the most influential. Initially launched in China as Douyin in September 2016 by ByteDance, the app swiftly gained attraction for its captivating 15-second video format enhanced with music and filters. Recognizing its potential, ByteDance introduced Douyin to the global market as TikTok in September 2017. To strengthen ByteDance’s presence in the U.S., the company acquired the popular lip-syncing app Musical.ly for around $1 billion in November 2017 and merged it with TikTok in August 2018, combining user bases and features. This strategic move led to explosive growth from 2018 to 2019, making it one of the most downloaded apps globally.";;

Through its viral challenges and diverse user base, TikTok has become a hub for community and shared experiences, making it easier for trends from previous decades to resurface and gain popularity among younger generations. 

When asked how TikTok has influenced their life, Ruby Moran ’24 said, “I ended up being influenced by it in a way similar to how one would be influenced by the group of friends they surround themselves with. I said I hated pink, I said I hated dresses, and I refused to learn how to do makeup mainly because of the commentary typically thrown around that made more feminine women seem weaker or somehow incompetent in a way.

;;;"Many current high school and college students grew up watching movies such as High School Musical, Camp Rock, and Step Up, which showcased high school as a time of parties, drama, and fun. However, many did not get to have that high school experience due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In stressful and unprecedented times, we long to feel some sense of stability and simplicity. Considering this, it’s no wonder the 90s and 2000s aesthetic reached further popularity because it reflects the pre-internet era, which is somewhat of a wonder to younger generations. Many people believe that the period embodies a carefree, enjoyable period.

One example of the booming popularity of the Y2K aesthetic is the 2000s makeup trend on TikTok. This trend consists mainly of transition videos to the song 10 Minutes by Lee Hyori, taken from her debut studio album Stylish, released on August 13th, 2003. The first few seconds of the TikTok videos feature people in their usual everyday look, which then cuts to a transition on how they interpret the 2000s style and how they would look in the early 2000s. ";;
;;;"While fashion and makeup are a significant aspect of the ’90s and 2000s aesthetic, they’re not the only factors being influenced by social media trends. Music is another widely changing element that the rise of social media has impacted. “I think TikTok has really influenced the variety of music that I have been exposed to. A lot of songs that become popular on TikTok make their way to mainstream music,” said Daniella Ginsberg ’24. Additionally, Sofia Fernandez ’26 said, “I often find songs that I like because of TikTok trends, and I end up adding it to my playlist sometimes.”

Songs from the 2000s are popular on TikTok because they are an ideal mix between familiarity and newness; older users embrace the provided nostalgia, while newer users are intrigued. The 1960s saw the rise of indie rock, rap rock, and alternative rock until the 2000s, when the computer age and globalization shaped rock music. However, as we get closer to a digital age, dance-pop, electronic dance music, and electropop became more prevalent in the 2010s.

;;;"One famous artist who brings back the rock style is Olivia Rodrigo. Her music genres consist of pop, punk, and rock, with songs like obsessed, good 4 u, and brutal. Her popularity comes from a large audience; her music is a blend of the pop that the newer generations know and the rock feel of older decades. Additionally, since Rodrigo is so young, her audience comprises primarily teens and young adults. With most of them being on TikTok, marketing her songs and content through the app is easy.

Along with classic rock, vinyl records became a new fascination as a younger generation of listeners discovered the music of previous decades. Previously, Record Store Day was the only day to purchase vinyl records for discounts after their popularity peaked in the 1980s. Now, vinyl record sales are returning for more than one or two days a year. Since the middle of the 2000s, sales have increased annually. Vinyl records surpassed CD sales in 2023 for the second year. 43 million records were sold in the US last year, bringing in $1.4 billion in income.";;
;;;"This vinyl revival could be the result of a much-needed break from the digital world. You can listen to any song you want worldwide with many streaming sources like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube. The thought of everything being at the touch of your fingertips is well known to the newer generations who had not grown up around older sources of music such as vinyl records, cassette tapes, and walkmans. However, these streaming apps take away from the personal aspect of buying and owning a physical item. 

Vinyls and CDs give you a sense of ownership that you can’t get anywhere else in this digital age. Instead of intangibly borrowing a song or album from its online library, when you buy a physical copy, you can feel the thought and effort that went into the music, the packaging of the albums, and any extra items you might get, such as a poster.

As younger generations navigate a digital landscape, they find comfort and identity in styles from the 90s and early 2000s, echoing a pre-internet simplicity that contrasts sharply with today’s fast-paced, interconnected world. This revival, evident in the resurgence of old music and the widespread adoption of Y2K fashion, underscores a collective yearning for authenticity and tangible experiences amidst the ephemeral nature of digital content.

The Y2K era, mostly known for its flashy fashion and futuristic designs, is having a major revival in 2025. Many are wondering, why is this style from decades ago suddenly reappearing? 

Part of the answer comes from TikTok, where thrift hauls, outfit inspos, and short videos of 2000s memorabilia are getting an uprise in views. Brands like Hollister are trying to revive their fan-adored 2000s collections with a new 25th-anniversary Y2K capsule collection. This includes signature styles like babydoll tops, ultra-low-rise shorts, and bootcut jeans. Locally, shops like Ingrid’s Vintage & Thrift Shop in St. Petersburg are preparing empty racks for the revival, offering affordable thrifted Y2K clothing alongside vinyls and decor. Online shopping has made it easier than ever for consumers to buy without hassle.

Because both artists began their careers on the Disney Channel— Rodrigo on Bizaardvark (2016–2019) and Carpenter on Girl Meets World (2014–2017) —the two stars have been in the public eye for quite a long time. 

As a longtime fan of both women, I am grateful their music careers have been fulfilling and met with a lot of love from listeners. Both artists still have so much to do and accomplish; their mainstream careers have taken off and have the capacity to go in any direction. But being so young means they are destined to change— their music, style, and personality will evolve as they navigate life.

Her first album, Sour (2021), was branded with “Y2K” nostalgia (glitter, stickers, purple, and butterfly clips), capturing teenage innocence, heartbreak, and angst. Reflected in her tour outfits, this style won the hearts of fans, but many pigeon-holed Rodrigo as the embodiment of this teenage-d innocence. 

Now, in the South American leg of her Guts World Tour, 22-year-old Olivia Rodrigo is facing online backlash for her “new” dances and outfits in her performances.

Honestly, I would be concerned if Rodrigo, a full-grown woman, continued with the “cutesy, school-girl act.” Guts (2023) is a lyrically and musically superior album to Sour (2021), and most fans share this sentiment. I can concede that people are entitled to find her grunge attitude ""cringe,"" but I feel there's something much more nuanced behind this backlash. I believe some critics are not voicing what they truly mean: that a woman is growing up with confidence and autonomy, and to them, that feels unnatural.

Former Disney star Sabrina Carpenter has faced similar flack, with some online commenters voicing discontent over the silhouette and sensual choreography featured in her performances. While I can understand preferences, I cannot back the argument that Carpenter needs to be “cautious of children in her audience.” This woman markets her explicit music to an adult market, not to mention that many who watched her on Disney Channel are now themselves adults or late-teens; thus, she is not responsible for catering to a younger group in her concerts. ";;
;;;Compared to men, women often face disproportionate criticism for sexualizing themselves during performances (Usher, Chris Brown, and The Weeknd, who are equally provocative, receive half the judgment). Female artists already have it hard with this double standard, so when a young woman with an innocent image transitions to a more adult brand, this evolution has little chance of not being rejected. This unfortunate reality reinforces this uncomfortable, societal ideal that women need to stay as innocent —pure— teenage girls for the rest of their lives. ;;

Y2K fashion emerged at the cusp of a new millennium.

Shiny fabrics, holographic textures, metallics, and space-inspired silhouettes were everywhere.

Iconic looks: low-rise jeans, baby tees, micro-mini skirts, velour tracksuits, butterfly clips, baguette bags, and rhinestones on everything.
Cultural drivers: Pop culture icons like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Paris Hilton popularized the aesthetic, while brands like Juicy Couture, Von Dutch, and Diesel defined it.
Mood: playful, experimental, and unapologetically glamorous.

;;;"The Decline (Mid 2000s – Early 2010s)
As the mid-2000s progressed, Y2K’s flashy optimism started to fade. The global recession and the rise of minimalist aesthetics led to a new fashion direction: muted palettes, skinny jeans, structured handbags, and tailored basics.

Fast fashion’s rise: H&M, Zara, and Forever 21 shifted focus to accessible minimalism rather than over-the-top glamour.
Cultural shift: Celebrities like the Olsen twins and Kate Moss introduced the “model-off-duty” aesthetic far from rhinestones and low-rises.
Mood: restrained, chic, and recession-conscious.

In short: From its flashy millennial origins to its Gen Z rebirth, Y2K fashion has proven that no trend truly dies it just waits for the next generation to remix it.";
The Gryphon;22 Oktober 2024;Why Y2K? What’s so Fascinating About the Decade we Were Born in?;Anna explores the new phenomena of gen-z being obsessed with Y2K and where this might’ve come from.;;https://www.thegryphon.co.uk/2024/10/22/why-y2k-whats-so-fascinating-about-the-decade-we-were-born-in/
;;;"Gen Z is obsessed with the early 2000s. The music, the fashion, the TV shows; we can’t get enough. Take a walk around Leeds Hyde Park and the outfits will transport you straight back to 2003. Nearly all of my friends and my favourite shows (Gilmore Girls, Greys Anatomy, One Tree Hill etc) started in the 2000s. Noughties pop-punk sounds have been revived by artists like Olivia Rodrigo, and Songs like Unwritten by Natasha Bedingfield and Murder on the Dancefloor by Sophie Ellis Baxtor, have trended all summer long.

So, what is it about a time before we even came into being that draws us to it so much?

I think that a lot of Gen Z feel cheated out of a time before social media and smartphones. Although most of us can remember this time from when we were kids, many of the biggest social media platforms blew up in the early 2010s, thus catapulting our existence online.

Since then, echoes of the words “life was so much better before iPhones!” ring through our ears, as we enviously devour videos of gigs without one single phone in the air, everyone present in the same moment. I even get pangs of nostalgia when I see a digital camera photo from the 2000s, despite not knowing a single person in it. ";"Gen Z is obsessed with the early 2000s.

;;;"How can we have such an intense longing for a time that existed before our consciousness?

French philosopher Jacques Derrida developed the idea of ‘Hauntology’, suggesting that we as a society are haunted by the “ghosts” of lost futures, our nostalgia for the past actually a yearning for a time that will never be again. I think this feeling is heightened by the space-age, technology inspired aesthetic that defined the early 2000s, anticipating a shiny exciting future that never quite landed.

Granted, this might be slightly too philosophical a reason to explain why the girlies are enjoying a low-rise jeans and big sunglasses moment. However, I do think there’s something truly special about the era right before technology changed human connection and interaction forever.

The resurgence of noughties tech like flip phones and digital cameras is a good example of this pushback against the modern. Whether its just for the aesthetic or not, the simplicity of the enjoyment that this tech brings hasn’t gone unnoticed. Maybe we actually don’t actually want one device that can do everything for us, and instead crave a romanticised “uncomplicated” time before our own? Or maybe those pictures just look better on your Instagram.";"How can we have such an intense longing for a time that existed before our consciousness?

These events weren’t just to accept awards, these events were the perfect opportunity to display your best fashion sense and leave a remarkable impact on American culture. From Britney Spears to Destiny’s Child, just to name a few, 2000s fashion hit different in the most positive way imaginable. ";;
;;;These looks were so impactful that they are still talked about today, by word-of-mouth and in the media. Many iconic Y2K looks were and are still shared in magazines, news coverage, and now online. Similarly, in 2025, Gen-Z is displaying timeless looks through the media using social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok to dictate what’s hot and what’s not.

Even the hottest retail stores and fashion brands are picking up on the Y2K comeback. ;
;;;"Retailers like Macy’s have started selling Von Dutch; Hot Topic has started selling Ed Hardy; and Urban Outfitters sells a variety of Y2K clothing, even dedicating a specific part of their website for Y2K and '90s outfits. There you can find baggy jeans, baby tees, sunglasses, bootcut jeans, cargo pants, and much more. Thrifting has also become very popular among Gen-Z as they search to find vintage pieces.";;
;;;"But that’s not all! Y2K Hair trends are back and better too; can’t leave that out. Butterfly clips are allowing fashionistas to get creative with their hair, adding color, art, and channeling their inner Lizzie McGuire. Celebrities like Millie Bobby Brown, Camila Cabello, and Olivia Rodrigo, who are all Gen-Z, have been spotted wearing butterfly clips online. Claw clips are also back, and this time not just for lazy hair days, but instead for a cute messy bun style or to add a specific aesthetic to their outfits. Spiky buns, crimped hair, flipped ends, and baby braids are also in and seem to be here to slay, oops, I mean stay.  ";;
;;;"The looks don’t stop at fashion and hair, though; beauty matters too! The memorable makeup, eyeshadow, eyebrows, shiny lip gloss, and body piercings are creeping back in. Gen-Z creators on Instagram and TikTok are recreating legendary Y2K makeup looks, incorporating a Bratz Doll aesthetic with lip liner, thin eyebrows, blush, and bold eye shadow. Having fun while also reviving trends has become a priority for many. Some creators are even taking it a step further and including their personal beliefs into their looks by specifically using makeup brands that align with their core values. ";;
;;;It wouldn’t be right if we didn’t speak on accessories that were popping in the Y2K era. What Gen-Z now calls “Hater Blockers” are essential to a Y2K look. Tinted Sunglasses, adding a playful energy to your look, are a fashion flex. In 2025, the youth are adding sunglasses to their look as a statement piece, often using sunglasses to show that their fit is a whole vibe. On TikTok, you can find many creators styling looks simply based on the energy that their “hater blockers” bring. Mini bags are also a fashion flex and a statement piece. Nowadays, Gen-Z doesn’t care how little the bag is or what may fit in it -- if it matches the overall aesthetic and serves a 10/10 look, that's all that matters.;;
;;;"Aren’t we forgetting something? Hint: Bling Bling! That's right, jewels. Jewelry, including name plate necklaces, rings, hoops, and bracelets, also adds flavor to the fit! Gen-Z is doubling up on the jewelry, and I am a perfect example of that. Layering necklaces, having rings on each finger, and custom earrings with my name on them is how I am incorporating my Y2K look daily. But, I am not alone; many of the youth are doing the same thing, creating a mood and aesthetic through their accessories. Accessories speak loud and clear and give off so much aura.";;
;;;Y2K looks aren’t going anywhere -- from baby tees, sunglasses, to butterfly clips, Y2K is serving main character energy, and Gen-Z is adding even more flavor. So next time you step outside, embrace your iconic 2000s era. It's not just a look, it's a lifestyle that Gen-Z has reinvented!;;
Rolling Stone;6 Maret 2024;Teen Angst Chic Is Back — What to Wear to Olivia Rodrigo’s ‘Guts’ World Tour;From pop-punk staples like loose ties and miniskirts, to Y2K butterfly clips and glitter, here's our guide on how to put together your fit before the concert;;https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/lifestyle/what-to-wear-olivia-rodrigo-guts-tour-1234981263/
;;;"Olivia Rodrigo is finally heading out on the road again to play her new album around the globe for the Guts world tour, which kicked off in Palm Springs on Feb. 23. Whether or not you’ve scored your tickets yet (which if you haven’t, you should get on that stat), if you’re planning on joining the crowd, pumping your fist and screaming “get him back!”, then the outfit-planning starts now.

Rodrigo released her second studio album Guts last fall, which served as a follow-up to her critically acclaimed first record, Sour. Full of punk-tinged bangers and heart-wrenching lyrics (“Only 19, but I fear they already got the best parts of me”), the pop-rock sensibilities that made the 21-year old’s album such a smash have found their way into the styles we’re already seeing from show-goers on tour.";;
;;;Even with just a few shows so far, the the #gutstour tag on TikTok has already surpassed over 500M views, and we’re already seeing wardrobe pieces like plaid pleated skirts, platform Doc Martens, and Y2K butterfly hair clips as core staples of the Guts tour “fit”. If you want to capture that Rodrigo style, lean into the early 2000s (think of those dElia*s catalogs references from her official merch store!). Not your style? Go for the softer, more refined TikTok trends we’ve seen Rodrigo rocking lately, such as coquette and rose appliqués. You could even pull from the limited-edition line of Olivia Rodrigo x Rolling Stone merch to celebrate her Rolling Stone cover (wink, wink).;;
;;;"Olivia Rodrigo ‘Guts’ Tour — What to Wear
To help you out, we’ve scoured through the internet and found the best Guts concert outfit ideas and head-turned looks inspired by Rodrigo herself, from sequin mini dresses to throwback denim handbags. Blow every bloodsucker in your section away and release your inner teen angst, because these are looks you’ll want to wear long after the concert is over.";;
;;;"All-American Bitch (Pretty in Purple)
With two albums under her belt, one thing about Rodrigo is obvious: the girl is in her purple era. Even if you won’t want to go full monochrome like we’ve seen some fans do, we recommend adding some violet or lavender accessories or single pieces as a reference to the Guts album. Whether it’s a mauve pleated miniskirt or purple Chuck Taylor high-tops, your Guts Tour outfit will fit right in (it never hurts to add a pop of color to your everyday wardrobe, anyways).";;
;;;"Ballad of a Homeschool Girl (Prep With An Edge)
While you may have felt like everything you did in high school was tragic, pull out the preppier side of your wardrobe for that anti-homeschool girl look, and be bold enough to stray into the pop punk side. Think Avril Lavigne meets uniform dress code with undone neckties, loafers, and plaid mini skirts for the Guts Tour this spring. These additions to your wardrobe will be perfect when autumn comes back around again, too.";;
;;;"Bad Idea, Right? (Pop-Punk Vibes)
If want to channel all the rage of missed teenage dreams, acne, and exes, go badass; we’re talking oversized graphic tees, Dr. Martens, ripped fishnets or baggy cargo pants. It’s a little rock & roll, a little punk, and it’ll be a great look for any other music festivals or concerts where you want to give off more “sk8r girl” than “lacy”.";;
;;;"Pretty Isn’t Pretty (Balletcore Coquette-ish)
Just because Rodrigo’s style includes heavy pop-punk influences doesn’t mean she hasn’t dabbled in softer, more femme-feeling fashion. If balletcore was the “it” look last year, this year you’ll be seeing more coquette vibes from concert-goers, the slightly more sophisticated alternative. Think more along the lines of pearl accessories and pink ribbons than wrap skirts — to achieve this look, focus on bows, lace, and leg warmers to complete your concert fit.";;
;;;"Teenage Dream (Sparkles Galore)
Pull cues from Rodrigo herself, since plenty of her best red carpet moments have featured sequins, and she’s continued to rock out with sparkly miniskirts as part of her tour wardrobe. Something like a sequin dress or top will totally make you feel like a total teenage dream on concert night (and it’ll make it easy to repurpose those glittery chrome pieces you got last year for the Eras or Renaissance tours). If you really want to go all out, you can even add some Nineties-style gems to your locks with this hair jeweler.";;
;;;"Vampire (Red, White, and Black)
If you want to really stand out from the crowd, take a inspiration from Rodrigo’s own wardrobe. It won’t make you a bloodsucker to copy her overall style, which tends to evoke a lot of nostalgia for 2010s fits — like her go-to Adidas Sambas and Converse sneakers, baby doll tees, or a pleated red mini skirt like the one she wore during her VMAs performance. Although it’s a bit of a departure from her Y2K aesthetic roots, it’s a nice way to keep the homage soft and minimal for your concert outfit.";"Vampire (Red, White, and Black)

;;;"Get Him Back (Y2K Throwback)
Rodrigo’s sound is influenced by the early 2000’s, so it only makes sense to go full Y2K for the Guts Tour. Reach for bright statement pieces (like novelty necklaces or shades) in colors like cotton candy pink, bright blue, and lime green. Low-rise jeans and camis are also totally appropriate here, and for accessories, finish it all off with some quintessential butterfly clips for a real throwback.";;

Meanwhile, Daisy Edgar-Jones brought gingham to Glastonbury, reworking the classic print with a festival edge. Her black-and-white Reformation mini (now sold out, naturally) paired with thick socks and glossy Hunter wellies offered a look that was both cool and unfussy. After all, who said gingham had to be precious?

While gingham is hardly new, it’s a perennial summer staple, and this season it feels fresher, easier and more wearable than ever. 

The beauty of it lies in its sheer versatility. Throw on a mini dress with chunky sandals and an oversized denim jacket for a pub lunch or zhuzh it up with strappy heels and a basket bag for brunch.

How Did Olivia Rodrigo & Louis Partridge Meet?";;
;;;"Although it seems like this loved up pair have been together forever now, the relationship rumours began just nine months ago, when they were first photographed with their arms wrapped around each other at a Halloween party during Olivia Rodrigo’s trip to London in October. 

Despite the photos being blurry, one thing was crystal clear: this duo were just destined to become Hollywood’s next ‘It’ couple. 

Their stint in London was the pair’s first public appearance together, however their story begins way before this. After parting ways with Pistol co-star Sydney Chandler, Louis Partridge was reportedly first introduced to Olivia Rodrigo through mutual friends back in early 2023.

Following their introduction, they had reportedly been “messaging quite a bit”, but hadn’t been seen together in public yet. It seems as though they managed to stay under the radar during the early days of their relationship -  until that momentous Halloween night.";;
;;;"Are Olivia Rodrigo & Louis Partridge Dating?
There has been no formal announcement as of yet, but we are taking their public displays of affection as evidence that Louis Partridge and Oliver Rodrigo are an item. 

On December 8th 2023, Partridge was seen in the crowd at Jingle Ball alongside Rodrigo’s best friends, recording her incredible performance, and reportedly having a whale of a time singing along to “all american b*tch”. That same weekend, after Rodrigo’s Saturday Night Live performance, Partridge was spotted celebrating alongside Rodrigo at an after party.

We love a supportive boyfriend, and Louis Partridge is the perfect example.

Shortly after on December 13th, Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge were snapped in a passionate embrace at a gas station in New York City. 

Fans immediately jumped on Twitter to share their excitement about the couple’s first major public PDA display. Following their steamy make out sesh at the gas station, the couple reportedly went on a romantic getaway to The Catskills just a few days after, and were also spotted strolling around the streets of NYC holding hands. We can’t cope with these two! ";;
;;;"Fans were eagerly anticipating how Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge would spend their first Valentine’s day together: and the couple certainly didn’t disappoint. They were photographed with their arms wrapped around each other at none other than Disneyland California.

Since their Disneyland trip, in between their busy schedules, Louis Partridge and OIivia Rodrigo have been spotted on several dinner dates, and Partridge has also been seen cheering Rodrigo on at several of her GUTS tour performances. The couple seem to be growing closer and closer as time goes on, and we just can’t wait to see what’s next for this gorgeous pair.";;
;;;"Who is Olivia Rodrigo? Olivia Isabel Rodrigo is a 21-year-old American singer-songwriter and actress, most known for her mesmerising soprano vocals and her emotional love songs that have earned her numerous accolades, including three Grammy awards, seven Billboard Music Awards and four MTV Video Music Awards. Pretty impressive, right? 

But Olivia Rodrigo is certainly no stranger to the spotlight. After showcasing an early affinity for music and spending her childhood writing songs and competing in local talent shows, Rodrigo rose to fame at the age of just 12, beginning her acting career as the leading lady in An American Girl: Grace Stirs Up Success.

Just two years later, she was cast as Paige Olvera in the Disney Channel’s originals series Bizaardvark. Continuing her journey with Disney, she also starred in the Disney+ series High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, taking on the role of musical theatre enthusiast Nini Salazar-Roberts. 

After writing and performing the promotional single 'All I Want' for the Disney+ series, the star clearly re-recognised her passion for music and decided to focus on her singing career, leaving after the end of the third series. Due to her incredible talent, unsurprisingly it didn’t take her long to secure a record deal, eventually leading to her releasing her debut single 'driver’s licence' just a year later.";;
;;;"Since her music career took off she has swiftly become a global sensation, touring around the world performing music from her iconic albums Sour and GUTS. Tickets for her London show sold out almost immediately, which just goes to show just how much her fans adore her.

As well as her incredibly catchy music and stunning singing voice, she is also admired by fans for openly discussing and spreading awareness about important topics such as Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ+ history. All we can say is, 'good for you', Olivia! 

Similarly to Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo’s songs also contain easter eggs about her love life. For instance, before she fell head over heels for her current boyfriend Louis Partridge, she previously dated her High School Musical: The Musical co-star Joshua Bassett, who is said to be the catalyst who inspired her to write her hit song 'drivers licence'.

Although Olivia Rodrigo’s new album GUTS contains many songs about heartbreak, one song in particular, 'so american' offers a refreshingly positive outlook on love, which many fans are convinced is a love letter to her current British beau Louis Partridge.";;
;;;"Who is Louis Partridge? Now we know a bit more about Olivia Rodrigo, let's talk about her other half! Louis Patrick James Partridge is a 21-year-old English actor, best known for his portrayal of the young Viscount Lord Tewkesbury in Netflix Film Enola Holmes, as well as his role as punk rock bank star Sid Vicious in the mini series Pistol. Talk about versatile, right?

Born and raised in Wandsworth, London, Partridge made his acting debut at the age of just 12, taking on the role of Felix in a short film titled Beneath Water, and it seems as though this was the opportunity that caused him to catch the acting bug: he hasn’t looked back since!

Following this, Louis Partridge’s child acting career blossomed, as during his adolescence the then-rising teenage star can be seen in several other films such as About a dog, Pan, Second Skin, and of course Enola Holmes which hurtled him into the limelight. 

But movies clearly aren’t his only forte. As well as his role as Sex Pistols icon Sid Vicious,  Louis Partridge actually first gained recognition after starring as Piero De Medici in the historical drama series Medici in 2019. He rose to further prominence two years later for his portrayal of immortal boy Peter Pan in The Lost Girls, gaining a reputation for his Disney prince good looks. 
";;
;;;"Before he began dating Olivia Rodrigo, Louis Partridge was previously romantically linked to Enola Holmes co- star Sydney Chandler, causing quite the stir on social media due to their eight year age gap. While we don’t know exactly when Louis Partridge and Sydney Chandler parted ways, he began being spotted out with current girlfriend Olivia Rodrigo at the end of 2023. 

Fun fact about Louis Partridge: despite being seen bopping to his girlfriend’s modern, alternative pop music during the first leg of the Olivia Rodrigo tour this year, the star’s music era of choice is the 80s. He has previously told MTV that his favourite bands include The Strokes, The Smiths and The Cure. 

As well as his acting talents, Louis Partridge is also an incredibly stylish Gen-Z dresser, and his eclectic outfit choices paired with his good looks led him to becoming an ambassador for Italian luxury fashion house, Prada. 

You may be wondering, what’s next for this fashion-loving, globally renowned acting phenomenon? Well, from what we’ve heard about his next project, he is on the cusp of mega-stardom!

Louis Partridge has been cast in the upcoming psychological thriller television mini series Disclaimer, alongside previously announced series leads and industry veterans Cate Blanchett and Kevin Kline. It seems that it’s definitely not just his relationship that’s blossoming!";;
;;;"Are Louis Partridge & Olivia Rodrigo Engaged? After 20 year old actress Millie Bobby Brown tied the knot with her partner Jake Bongiovi earlier this year, it’s natural for all eyes to turn towards Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge as the next young celebrity couple to say ‘I do.’

Although Olivia Rodrigo’s boyfriend Louis hasn’t posed that all important question just yet, it certainly doesn’t seem like the couple are very far away from that stage. After all, it’s no secret that the pair have been inseparable since that Halloween night, and they are showing every sign that they will end up going the distance. 

In her song 'so american', rumoured to be written about her boyfriend Louis Partridge, Olivia Rodrigo sings: “Oh God, I’m gonna marry him.” If this isn’t a hint, we don’t know what is!

In January 2024, it was rumoured on TikTok that Louis Partridge had introduced his girlfriend Olivia Rodrigo to his beloved parents, as a user had spotted the group enjoying a drink together in a pub in the Isle Of Wight. There were no paparazzi pictures taken of this meet-up, so we cannot confirm that it’s definitely true, however if it is it could be a sign that a proposal may just be around the corner.
";;
;;;"Louis Partridge has also been spotted at several of Olivia Rodrigo’s GUTS world tour performances, and he appears to be travelling with his girlfriend from stop to stop. Recently, Olivia Rodrigo commented: ""welcome to the 21 club angel boy!!!"" on her boyfriend Louis Partridge’s 21st birthday post.

If Olivia’s comment proves anything, it’s that it’s clear these two are no longer afraid to display their love for one another for the world to see. Only time will tell whether they choose to tie the knot in the foreseeable future.";;
;;;"Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge: Wedding Predictions
Although Louis Partridge and Olivia Rodrigo aren’t engaged just yet, of course we couldn’t help but plan their dream wedding! After all, one thing’s for certain, the pair are truly enamoured with each other, so it can’t be a “bad idea, right?” 

Keep reading as we reveal our wedding predictions for Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge.";;
;;;"The Venue: Motel - East London
Louis Partridge and Olivia Rodrigo are the ultimate Y2K Gen Z couple, so naturally, we think that they would choose a unique wedding venue that is of course anything but cheugy! That’s why, for our fantasy wedding for this inseparable pair we’ve selected Motel, an alternative style, bespoke urban wedding venue in Shoreditch, ideal for couples who desire to celebrate their love in style!

We also think that it would be particularly special if the pair were to tie the knot in London, because not only is it of course Louis Partridge’s home city, it is the city where they were seen together for the first time at Halloween last year. 

Located in the heart of Hackney, this enchanting wedding venue seamlessly marries Victorian London industrial chic with mid-century style and luxury. The magical Shoreditch space is nothing short of a showstopper, but also has an undeniably quirky atmosphere that is sure to appeal to the couple.

What’s also great is that Motel’s versatile and interconnected spaces allow couples to create a truly personalised wedding experience and bring their unique vision to life, which we’re sure Olivia and Louis would appreciate, both being creatives! ";;
;;;"Since its inception in 2010, Motel has transformed from a photography studio to a stunning and incredibly sought after wedding venue. With a history of hosting shoots carried out by several high fashion houses, including none other than Louis Vuitton and Dior, it’s no surprise that this venue has become the go to choice for couples searching for a setting with a stylish edge. 

We may be stereotyping slightly here, but being a Gen-Z couple, we are sure that this pair would consider an instagrammable setting as uncompromisable when choosing their wedding venue. But the couple needn’t worry with Motel, as this venue’s breathtakingly elegant spaces display 150 year old architectural detailing complemented by contemporary design, making for the perfect industrial chic style backdrop. 

Perfectly aligning with their playful personalities and edgy styles, we believe that Motel would be an incredibly strong contender for Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge in their unique wedding venue search. ";;
;;;"Entertainment: Boujee Music - Uptown Showdown As mentioned before, Louis Partridge is quite the fan of a good old throwback tune, often turning back to the past for his music fix as opposed to sticking with what’s currently in the charts.

His pop princess girlfriend Olivia Rodrigo’s music taste is incredibly versatile: according to an article by PopSugar in 2021, her 18 favourite songs range from “Picture to Burn” by Taylor Swift all the way to “Somebody Told Me” by The Killers. So, to appeal to both of their music tastes, when picking their evening entertainment the couple would definitely need to pick a band that can do a bit of it all! 

We may just have found their perfect match: Boujee Music, aka the one stop shop for all of your wedding music needs. It’s no secret that live music has the ability to create an unbeatable ambience, and Boujee Music offer a broad range of live music bands who can play a wide variety of music styles and genres.

Boujee Music’s live band ‘Uptown Showdown’ in particular would be perfect for Louis Partridge and Olivia Rodrigo, as they are renowned for their incredible enthusiastic energy that makes everyone flock to the dance floor, as well as their versatile set list which has something for every guest.

From current pop hits to timeless Motown classics, they can play it all, and we have no doubt that they would make Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge’s wedding a night to remember! ";;

She has also been spotted at an Italian pizzeria in London at one of her many dinner dates with Louis Partridge. 

That’s why for Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge’s fantasy wedding caterers, we have opted for none other than Pizzeria Al Forno, providing the most mouth watering, Neapolitan-style pizzas made with their signature secret homemade tomato sauce.

What’s even more great about Pizzeria Al Forno is that their pizzas feature the freshest and most authentic Italian ingredients, and they have an option for any guest, whether they are a meat eater, vegan, vegetarian or lactose and gluten intolerant, Pizzeria Al Forno are accommodating to every guest’s dietary needs!";;
;;;"Wedding Flowers: Pesh Flowers - Bromley Any Olivia Rodrigo fan would know that the singer’s favourite colour is purple. In fact, she loves the colour so much that it has become a signature theme on her album covers, so we definitely think that purple would inevitably make an appearance at least somewhere in her floral arrangements. 

As a creative couple, we are sure that Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge will also have a unique vision in mind for their wedding decorations, including their flowers. With this in mind, we have chosen Bromley Based Pesh Flowers as a florist for their imaginary wedding, due to their focus on creating bespoke arrangements that capture a couple’s personality, bringing their vision to life.

The Fashion Spot;20 Januari 2025;Olivia Rodrigo Does Classic Chic Right in Polka Dot Gradient Dress;If it’s a polka dot dress, you know Olivia Rodrigo is wearing it. The singer, who has been recently championing this trend, gave it a gradient twist in her new look. While stepping out in NYC’s Chelsea neighborhood on Friday, the star did classic chic right in a slinky black gradient dress featuring white polka dots throughout the bodice. Rodrigo has displayed several eye-catching street styles in recent times, but her love for polka dots is not new. Her inclination toward this popular fashion trend proves that simplistic looks are always a hit. ;;https://www.thefashionspot.com/fashion-news/898128-olivia-rodrigo-polka-dot-gradient-dress-miu-miu-leather-bag/
;;;"Olivia Rodrigo elevates simple yet classic dress with Miu Miu leather bag  Olivia Rodrigo is one of the few celebrities who embrace and effortlessly pull off minimalistic fashion. The pop star has taken a liking to the classic Y2K style — the polka dot print. On Friday, she was spotted in NYC for a showing of “Music For A While.” The singer stepped out of her car to display her simple yet classic gradient dress with polka dot prints. It is safe to say that Rodrigo has a separate love for timeless looks. 

The dress featured an off-the-shoulder neckline alongside eye-catching gradient elements. The black outfit appeared to feature a darker shade of fabric in the bodice as compared to the skirt. Moreover, the white polka-dot patterns contributed a playful twist, proving that polka-dots can never be boring. They shifted in size from top to bottom, adding an element of asymmetry to the evening ensemble. The singer complemented her dress with a navy overcoat.";;
;;;"Rodrigo elevated her simple yet classic polka-dot dress with a trendy handbag. According to Marie Claire, the singer carried Miu Miu’s Adventure nappa leather top-handle bag. Furthermore, her red Rouge Puffer Case from Urban Sophistication added a pop of color to her otherwise dark fit. She completed her look with minimal accessories and flirty peep-toe heels. Moreover, the singer kept her long tresses open and in soft waves with a messy middle part. Rodrigo also kept her glam minimal, which was in tune with her outfit. 

Previously, Olivia Rodrigo wore a chic polka-dot dress in December while promoting her LinkBuds collaboration with Sony Electronics. Taking over the NYC subway, she wore a pattern-heavy Dana Foley navy dress with white polka-dot prints. Given her fascination with the trend, it looks like the artist isn’t leaving her polka-dot fad anytime soon. ";;

;;;"From Billboard, the resurgence of pop-punk

In the world of fashion, supermodels epitomised beauty in the 2000s, promoting a narrow standard of beauty upheld by fashion trends catering primarily to slim body types. Staples like low-rise jeans and backless tops accentuated this ideal while excluding other body types, perpetuating societal norms that fuelled body dysmorphia, extreme diet culture, and fashion industry exclusivity. While society actively has worked to address these issues for the past decade, seeing these toxic standards resurface feels like a step back in our progress towards inclusivity.";;
;;;"The change in beauty standards is evident if we compare society’s beauty ideology in the past decade. Before the onset of Y2K nostalgia in 2020, the hourglass and curvy Kardashian-inspired body type was the desired beauty. But with the resurgence of Y2K nostalgia, even the Kardashians themselves are now moving away from this trend, signalling a return to a preference for slim body types. The recent rise in the misuse of Ozempic (medicine for adults with type 2 diabetes) to lose weight rapidly over the past three years, coincides with the revival of beauty standards inspired by the Y2K era. These changes are arguably not coincidental but rather reflective of shifting societal ideals.

As the allure of Y2K nostalgia continues to shape our cultural landscape, it's imperative to acknowledge its dual nature. While it evokes warm memories and a sense of comfort, we mustn't forget the darker undertones that lurk beneath its surface. By recognising the problematic aspects of our past, we pave the way for a more inclusive and empathetic future. Let us embrace nostalgia with caution, understanding that it is not merely a trip down memory lane, but a reflection of our collective journey, with all its complexities and contradictions.";"The change in beauty standards is evident if we compare society’s beauty ideology in the past decade.

BRIT + CO;22 Maret 2024;"The New Olivia Rodrigo ""Guts"" Music Video Is ""The Summer I Turned Pretty"" Meets ""Wednesday""";"Olivia Rodrigo's Guts is the sonic equivalent of a no-holds-barred burn book, its pages crying out to be plastered on lockers and bathroom walls, to be seen by everyone. This sophomore album is even more relatable than the singer's first, and seamlessly touches on every half-written, heartbroken rant lying dormant in our notes app, transforming them into electrifying lyrics you can't help but belt.

Unlike its predecessor, Sour (the 2021 chart-topper that truly launched Rodrigo from High School Musical star to global sensation), Guts delves deep into the duality of heartbreak — and the existentialism we all feel, no matter our age. ""It's SO GOOD, social lead Mallory Levy said after the drop. ""I'm not in this age group but I feel [their experience] and am instantly transported. The perfect mix of Taylor [Swift]-level lyrics + Paramore-level angst that I never knew I needed.""

Y2K-inspired pop punk guitars echo throughout the album, adding an extra layer of intensity to Rodrigo’s rage-fueled confessions. Guts undeniably provides the soundtrack to those earth-shattering breakups that propel every girl into womanhood, those gut-wrenching moments when it's hard to let go, even when you know it’s for the best. It’s a collection of anthems for identity crises, and a musical odyssey through female fury and adolescent heartbreak.";;https://www.brit.co/olivia-rodrigo-guts/
;;;"Is there a music video for Obsessed by Olivia Rodrigo? Yes, the ""Obsessed"" music video debuted on March 22, and it's giving major Wednesday and The Summer I Turned Pretty vibes! The song is all about being, well, obsessed with your partner's ex. You can just *feel* Olivia's anxiety through the lyrics. And the music video is a super fun take on a beauty pageant/cotillion situation, with all of her partner's exes prepping to compete against each other. While all the other women are in white, Olivia wears an edgy black dress Wednesday Addams would approve of, with her socks adding Guts' signature red to the outfit.";;
;;;Is there a deluxe version of GUTS? Yes, during her Oliva Rodrigo's tour, the singer announced the Guts deluxe edition, which she's calling Guts (Spilled)! The new edition will be released Friday, March 22. In addition to the songs we already have from the original album, Olivia Rodrigo is releasing the fan-favorite “Obsessed,” as well as “Girl I’ve Always Been,” “Scared of My Guitar,” “So American,” and “Stranger.”;;
;;;"What song did Olivia Rodrigo sing at the Grammys? At the 2024 Grammys, Olivia Rodrigo sang ""Vampire"" in a red silk dress. The purple virtual background featured some red flowers, but as Olivia sang, the flowers started to bleed. And the longer the song went on, the gorier the scene got (including some fake blood makeup Olivia smeared on her face). I love this approach to the ""Vampire"" music video because it captures its chaotic energy but feels much more sophisticated. Plus Olivia sounded amazing!!";;
;;;"Ranking Every Track On Olivia Rodrigo's ""Guts,"" A Nearly Impossible Task
Making The Bed
Most Relatable Lyric: “Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread // And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head”

Now that dreaming about fortune and fame is in Rodrigo’s rearview, ""Making The Bed"" walks us through the bittersweet reality of getting everything you’ve ever wanted. After all, we can probably all relate to putting our desires on a pedestal and then feeling confused when the reality of those dreams isn't what we expected.";;
;;;"Vampire
Most relatable lyric: ""I tried you help you out, now I know that I can't // 'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand.""

What could be considered the only power ballad on the album, the lyrics in ""Vampire"" remind us of the “Driver's License""-esque emotions we’ve come to love (and expect) from Rodrigo. She's proven she can fuse anger and regret while still empowering listeners, and ""vampire"" sinks its teeth in, a theatrical roller-coaster ride worth the repeat.

Lacy
Most relatable lyric: ""I feel your compliments like bull?ts on skin // Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnate // W?ll, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist?""

Reminiscent of classic green-eyed songs before it, like Dolly Parton’s “Jolene,” ""Lacy"" is a portrait of the other woman. Rodrigo doesn’t outright beg Lacy not to steal her man, but instead details her own flaws through Lacy’s perceived perfections. For Rodrigo, “lacy” is but a characterization of unrealistic expectations that she’s made real.";;
;;;"Ballad Of A Homeschooled Girl
Most relatable lyric: ""Everythin' I do is tragic // Every guy I like is gay // The morning after I panic // Oh, God, what did I say?""

Rodrigo reckons with her fear of being seen and of saying the right things. From constantly missing social cues to speaking just to have something to say, ""Ballad Of A Homeschooled Girl"" mirrors the life of a girl who spends her time twiddling her thumbs one minute and over-analyzing literally everything the next. SO RELATABLE";;
;;;"All-American B*tch
Most relatable lyric: ”And I am built like a mother and a total machine // I feel for your every little issue, I know just what you mean”

Leading the already iconic tracklist, ""All-American B*tch"" foreshadows the growing pains and base level of dissatisfaction young women often endure. Caring so much about other people who don't return the favor — even when you wish you didn't — can be really uncomfortable, and whether you're shouldering the emotional baggage of an unattached partner or struggling to maintain the cool girl image, ""All-American B*tch"" hits the nail on the head.

Bad Idea Right?
Most relatable lyric: ”And I'm sure I've seen much hotter men // But I really can't remember when”

If the saying “rose-colored glasses” existed as a lyric, this would be it. In her second single following “Vampire,” Rodrigo falls into the trap of reconnecting with her ex. “Bad idea right?” It’s a tale as old as time. Do we really need to explain more?";;
;;;"The Grudge
Most relatable lyric: “We both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal // I try to be tough, I try to be mean // But even after all this, you're still everything to me”

Seeing the end of any relationship that once meant a lot to you is so, so painful — especially when you still care about the person. Grudges usually have a purely negative connotation, and we love to see how Rodrigo emphasizes how her grudge is one of love as much as it is hate, making it extra bittersweet.

Logical
Most relatable lyric: ""Said I was too young, I was too soft // Can't take a joke, can't get you off""

""Logical"" is for every woman who has ever been infantilized by someone she adored. Gaslighters beware. Rodrigo’s merry-go-round storytelling highlights the emotional tension between the love she felt for her ex and their emotional manipulation.";;
;;;"Get Him Back!
Most relatable lyric: ""I wanna kiss his face with an uppercut // I wanna meet his mom and tell her her son sucks!""

This song bares the consequences of not immediately hitting the block button when your ex calls. While some of the slower songs on Guts highlight the way love and regret coexist, “Get Him Back!” takes a more upbeat, funny approach that also touches on Rodrigo's frustration.

Love Is Embarrassing
Most relatable lyric: “God, love's f*ckin' embarrassin'”

Another running theme throughout Olivia Rodrigo's Guts? Confusion. But instead of just talking about a partner, Rodrigo's confusion in ""Love Is Embarrassing"" is also directed towards the nature of romance itself, as well as the lengths we're willing to go for people we tell ourselves we shouldn't care about. In short: yes, love is very embarrassin'.";;
;;;"Pretty Isn't Pretty
Most relatable lyric: ""I could change up my body and change up my face // I could try every lipstick in every shade // But I'd always feel the same // 'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough anyway""

Social media, photo editing, and the like have taken a serious toll on the way we see ourselves (after all comparing yourself to the people you see on social media can literally make you more unhappy with your appearance). In what feels like an indirect sequel to Sour's ""Jealousy, Jealousy,"" ""Pretty Isn't Pretty"" is a reminder that external beauty isn't the end-all-be-all.

Teenage Dream
Most relatable lyric: ""When am I gonna stop being a pretty young thing to guys? // When am I gonna stop being great for my age and just start being good? // When will it stop being cool to be quietly misunderstood?""

Rodrigo comes out swinging on Guts' finale (the title of which calls back to a lyric from Sour's opening number ""Brutal""). She worries that her glory days are already behind her, and like so many of us, craves to be known, chosen, and loved for exactly who she is — and not for her talent, or her looks, or her brain — whether or not that makes her the ultimate ""teenage dream.""";;
;;;"Yes! We've gotten three music videos so far: ""Vampire,"" ""Bad Idea Right?,"" and ""Get Him Back!"" The ""Vampire"" music video emphasizes the scrutiny Olivia Rodrigo feels in the spotlight";;
;;;"The ""Bad Idea Right?"" music video totally feels like a scene out of Euphoria — which helps highlight how youthful and chaotic the song actually is. The music video for ""Get Him Back!"" is genius for one reason: by adding multiple Olivia's throughout the video, she highlights how it feels like there are multiple versions of herself because of how many different things she wants.";;
;;;"When did Guts come out?
Olivia Rodrigo's Guts dropped on September 8 and we cannot tell you how many time we've listened to the whole thing. When did Vampire come out?
""Vampire"" began streaming on all music platforms June 30, while the follow-up single ""bad idea right?"" was released on August 10.";;
;;;"Who is Olivia Rodrigo?  Olivia Rodrigo, 20, rose to fame during her role as Nini on High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. A talented singer and actress, Rodrigo was launched into the public spotlight thanks to Sour and fans' speculation that it touched on a suspected love triangle between her, her (now ex) BF and HSMTMTS co-star Joshua Bassett and singer Sabrina Carpenter.

While the public has (mostly) moved on from the rumors, Rodrigo’s talent shined and the singer sent TikTok spiraling with the release of “Driver's License,” followed by Sour in 2021. Today, the three-time Grammy winner is besties with pop culture power players Iris Apatow, Conan Grey, Billie Eilish, Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Charlie D’Amelio, Maddie Ziegler, and more. She's also shared the stage with celebrity icons such as Avril Lavigne, Paris Hilton, and Billy Joel.";;

Katie Ransome recaps Olivia Rodrigo’s journey to now as she headlines this year’s Glastonbury Sunday.";Hailing from humble beginnings, Rodrigo first gained global recognition appearing in the series reboot of Disney’s High School Musical.;;https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrities/disney-glastonbury-headliner-olivia-rodrigos-rise-fame-1421112.html
;;;"efore her music career, the young actress also starred in multiple American Girl Doll films - namely ‘Grace Stirs Up Success’ and ‘Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front’.

Aged out of child acting, Rodrigo switched focus to songwriting, signing with Geffen Records in 2021. 

Releasing her first single, ‘Driver’s License’, later that year proved to be the turning point in her rise to international stardom. 

Ranking number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for eight weeks in a row, the tunes' relatable backstory of young love and heartbreak also canvassed Spotify, Apple and Amazon charts.

With the world in the midst of a global pandemic, Drivers License inevitably made its rounds onto social media platforms like TikTok, racking up hundreds of millions of fan reactions and recreations. 

Following ‘Drivers Licenses’ instant success, Rodrigo delivered a further three singles (‘Deja Vu’, ‘Good 4 u’ & ‘Like a damn sociopath'), culminating in the much anticipated release of her breakout album SOUR. ";;
;;;"An Album to Remember 
Upon its release, ‘SOUR’ received critical acclaim and went on to win several Grammy Awards during the event's 64th edition. 

The album's nods to vulnerability, Y2K aesthetics and sentimental discography ultimately led to its continued popularity years later. 

Despite a dream start on paper, rumours of copyright infringements emerged soon after the release of the album. 

Keen-eared listeners of ‘Deja Vu’ and ‘Good 4 u’ cited similarities in chords to pre-released songs from the likes of Taylor Swift, Hayley Williams and Paramore. 

Overcoming the critics, Rodrigo kicked off a sold-out tour of SOUR in 2022.

Spanning 2023 to this year (2025), Rodrigo has debuted a further barrage of content, including a new album, GUTS and singles ‘Vampire’ and ‘Bad idea right?’.

Set to become the festival’s second youngest headliner and first artist whose debut single was released the same decade as performing, Rodrigo will take to the infamous Pyramid Stage this Sunday from 9:45 pm.";;
L'Officiel ;17 April 2024;Why is Gen Z So Obsessed with Y2K Fashion?;"Nostalgia rules the fashion cycle but each generation is different; while Millennials hang onto '90s trends, Gen Z finds comfort in the not-too-distant styles of the early 2000s.";"Nostalgia rules the fashion cycle but each generation is different; while Millennials hang onto '90s trends, Gen Z finds comfort in the not-too-distant styles of the early 2000s.";https://www.lofficielusa.com/fashion/gen-z-y2k-millennial-90s-fashion-nostalgia
;;;"Born between 1997 and the early 2010s, Gen Z grew up with cell phone in hand, and have been quick to adapt to new technology and trends. The selfie generation, TikTok teens, or whatever you want to call them are accustomed to consuming entertainment, social media, fashion, and more at the push of a button.

In keeping with that sense of immediacy, young people celebrate and discard trends at lightning speed, further accelerating the cyclical nature of fashion. These days, microtrends emerge and fade in a matter of weeks, thanks to oversaturation on social media and fast fashion outlets. From off-the-shoulder tops to the mob wife aesthetic to all the ""-core"" trends—think cottagecore, cowboycore, and mermaidcore as recent examples—the influence of social media is more prevalent than ever in the way Gen Z shops and styles their clothing. ";;
;;;"That being said, the one trend that Gen Z hasn't been able to cast aside is the resurgence in Y2K fashion. With cargo pants, low-rise jeans, tracksuits, Ugg boots, headbands, and baby tees back in the wardrobes of Gen Z fashion enthusiasts across the globe, it's hard not to turn our eyes to the enduring influence of the 2000s.

While Y2K style elements trend on TikTok every so often, teens on the Internet aren't the only members of Gen Z looking to the past. Celebrities and style icons like Bella Hadid, Olivia Rodrigo, and Kaia Gerber have embraced the fashion looks of their childhoods and have served as Y2K style inspirations for fellow celebrities and their social media followers alike. Whether Gen Z is wearing dresses over jeans à la Miley Cyrus or reviving leopard print, there's no denying the continued interest in the fashion of the 2000s.";;
;;;"Just as Millenials have anchored their attention toward quintessential '90s styles, Gen Z has locked into a committed relationship with Y2K styles.

Both generations have latched onto their respective nostalgia-fuelled trends, displaying how vintage-inspired fashion and its celebration of the past have evolved into a source of escapism and comfort. For Millennials, who grew up in the wake of 9/11 and came of age during the 2008 Great Recession, looking back to their adolescence in the '90s and the aesthetic cues of those times offers a sense of familiarity as the world shifts uncertainly around them. Studies have shown that Millennials are particularly risk averse, and in the fashion realm, that means they would rather return to a tried and true trend, making the '90s era of minimalism a natural style choice.

";
;;;"For over half a decade, '90s style has dominated runways. Hedi Slimane's Fall/Winter 2013 collection for Saint Laurent leaned into the moodiness of '90s youth culture. In 2018, Marc Jacobs reissued his Perry Ellis Grunge collection, and the next year, Versace brought back its bondage dresses. Now, up-and-comer Sandy Liang’s late ‘90s-inspired looks have officially made her a go-to cool-kid label. The decade that is characterized by grunge and minimalism is reflected in the street style of Millennial influencers.

On social media, the '90s also live on. Instagram archives of style and celebrities in the 1990s, like the @90sanxiety account, share 25-year-old images of Jennifer Lopez en route to the gym in typical '90s styles to 2.6 million followers. But as @90sanxiety grows in popularity among Millenials, another account is growing too. Following suit, @2000sanxiety has over 320,000 Instagram followers and counting. Y2K-era styles as originally worn by It Girls like Britney Spears, Devon Aoki, and Lindsey Lohan garner hundreds of thousands of likes. Thanks to accounts like this, old photos of the era's biggest celebrities have circulated the internet, ending up as style inspiration photos on Pinterest boards and TikTok slideshows of young Gen Z users across the world. 

";;
;;;"While Millennials may not want to don frosted eyeshadow and recreate high school yearbook photos, the aesthetic of the early aughts has found a home with Gen Z. Butterfly clips, velour sweatsuits, and tinted sunglasses are taking over TikTok. Dua Lipa—admittedly born one year too soon to technically be a member of Gen Z but a Gen Z icon nonetheless—has rocked bleached bangs reminiscent of Christina Aguilera’s chunky highlights.

Even aspects of the early 2000s scene kid look have returned. E-boys (and e-girls) are rocking painted nails, waffle-knit tees, and crop tops with such confidence that Celine named its Spring/Summer 2021 collection “The Dancing Kid” in their honor. Influencers like TaraYummy and Jake Webber reign supreme on TikTok and Youtube as the It Emo style icons to emulate, and indie sleaze styles have seen a renaissance on social media as the newest wave of cool-girl fashion.

Meanwhile, viewers can relive the awkwardness of middle school by streaming Hulu's popular Pen15, which follows two teens in the year 2000, complete with a number of the era's quintessential fashion moments, from pedal pushers and baby tees to cargo pants and bedazzling. While Millenials regard these looks as cringe-worthy, Gen Z has drawn inspiration from the polarizing fashion era. ";;
;;;Gen Z’s embrace of early 2000s style, however, is not just a case of looking to the past for aesthetic inspiration. For those that grew up on the edge of the pre-iPhone, pre-social media era, the early 2000s represent a nebulous period of barely memorable, blissful ignorance. When Kim Kardashian West is pictured on @90sanxiety, it's easy to marvel at the grainy, film-developed images. But when she's on @2000sanxiety, it's hard not to be amused at how recently she was Paris Hilton's sidekick. ;;
;;;"While personal memory drives a love for '90s fashion among Millennials, for Gen Z, it's more an appeal of aesthetic tastes.  for the younger generation, the ‘90s represents a far-off fashionable fantasy depicted only in film photos and polaroids, whereas the 2000s are a distant but recognizable reality.

Every generation faces new struggles, but the introduction of social media, the smartphone, video games that track your body, and other technology has dramatically changed the experience of childhood at an unprecedented and, frankly, terrifying rate since the late 1990s.";;
;;;In these tumultuous, ever-changing times, designers like Marine Serre, Balenciaga, and Gucci have used fashion to express a simultaneous nostalgia for the past and an escapist future. Gen Z’s incorporation of early 2000s pieces into their contemporary outfits represents a similar effort. Longing for the early 2000s is less about the social and political realities of the era, and more about the period presented in shows quite literally named The Simple Life. When the present seems scary, Gen Z returns to the comfort and simplicity of childhood or adolescent fashion as an homage to the easy euphoria of days long past, whether that looks like Y2K-esque loungewear or low-rise jeans. ;In these tumultuous, ever-changing times, designers like Marine Serre, Balenciaga, and Gucci have used fashion to express a simultaneous nostalgia for the past and an escapist future.

;;;"Today, Gen Z is known for valuing sustainability and social change, but for those without massive budgets, the perceived need to consume both ethically and quickly has led to a burgeoning online vintage and resale market, which is where the reign of second-hand shopping apps like Depop and Grailed come in. 

 90 percent percent of Depop’s users are under 26, and about one-third of people aged 16 to 24 in the UK use the app. ""Y2K"" has become a popular hashtag on Depop, indicating the established market for early 2000s trends. Dubbing the era Y2K—1999's infamous widespread panic over a digital apocalypse—feels like a coping mechanism for our current situation. The irony is, however, that Gen Z users claiming Y2K styles are too young to remember the genuine concern over the Y2K bug and the possibility of computers failing at the turn of the millennium–but they do remember the Juicy Couture tracksuits, low-rise denim, and bedazzling phenomenon that subsequently dominated fashion in the early 2000s. ";;
;;;Thrifting culture has also run rampant among the younger generation, as seen through an influx of vintage store hauls on Instagram and TikToks posted by teenagers chronicling hangout sessions at second-hand shops. While Millenials and Gen X women are eager to cast aside their polarizing 2000s pieces, Gen Z is eager to give them a new home in their own wardrobes. Low-rise jeans, baby tees—sometimes sourced straight from the children's section—and micro skirts are all particularly sought-after pieces these days, and while some Gen Zers opt to shop new, revamped Y2K styles, others seek the aisles of thrift stores for their 2000s fashion fix. After all, where better to seek affordable, sustainable looks? ;;

Nostalgia-induced fashion is not by any means a new phenomenon—think the cyclical fashion phenomenon—but Gen Z’s growing fascination with the early 2000s is more than just a case of everything old becoming new again.

;;;There's no denying that the 2020s have been a collective period of chaos, what with the upcoming U.S. election, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the climate change crisis, and with all the disorder and confusion that adulthood has brought Gen Z, it’s hard not to wish for the not-too-distant days when adolescence and early adulthood were all about going to the mall.;;
AOL;16 November 2024;Olivia Rodrigo’s Exposed Bejeweled G-String Is Straight Out of the ‘00s;"Showing the straps of your underwear beneath a put-together outfit sounds like it should be a fashion faux pas. And yet, there was nothing chicer in the noughties than exposing your thong. Wearing the spaghetti-thin straps of your G-string (yes, it had to be a G-string; Brazilian undies wouldn’t have achieved the same ~lewk~) high up on your hips so they sat above the low-rise waistband of your skirts, jeans, and Juicy Couture velour sweatpants were the very definition of peak Y2K style.

If the above triggers post-traumatic stress-inducing flashbacks, we suggest you stop reading now because Olivia Rodrigo has recreated this exact trend in her latest outfit. Stepping out at the Billboard Live Music Summit in Hollywood last night (November 14), the artist repped an ensemble that was straight out of the ‘00s. Obvi, of course, the entire thing is kinda ironic given the 21-year-old was just a bb at the height of the exposed thong’s sartorial reign.";;https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/olivia-rodrigo-exposed-bejeweled-g-173000928.html

“There was a moment I stood surrounded by a collection of the most frustrated, piercing screams I’d ever heard in real life. Don’t get me wrong, there were cathartic moments throughout Olivia Rodrigo’s entire set. She performed all of her modern classics, from the self-effacing ones (“ballad “of a homeschooled girl”) to the gut-wrenchingly and transparently heartbroken ones (“enough for you”), that have granted her hitmaker status. But it was during “all-american bitch,” when Olivia demanded that thousands of Gov Ball festival attendees let out their worst, most authentic screams, that we were all confronted with the true power of her artistry. Olivia allows you to acknowledge, and sometimes indulge, your pettiest thoughts and most insecure behaviors. The ones that the rest of us might be too scared to address, but she’s often brave enough to immortalize in her music. The screams I heard that night were all the sign I needed that she’s an artist with something to say, and one who’s definitely being heard.”";;

But one of the major highlights was hearing his cover of Dolly Parton’s ‘Jolene,’ adding a new kind of layer to the old track when sung by an icon like Conan.

ICYMI: Rodrigo released her second studio album, ""Guts,"" last fall, which served as a follow-up to her critically acclaimed first record, ""Sour."" The album played into many of the same pop-rock sensibilities that made the musician's debut such a hit, with punk instrumentals and melodies inspired by bands like Paramore, teamed with the same thoughtful, heart-wrenching lyricism that mirrors artists like Taylor Swift. Rodrigo has managed to build an entire brand around her unique sound, even further elevating her image through her personal style choices — most of which pay homage to the fashion trends of the early aughts via cropped graphic tees, platform Mary Janes, pleated miniskirts, and the occasional mesh piece or two.";;https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/what-to-wear-to-a-olivia-rodrigo-concert-49311969

;;;For the outing, the singers each brought their own flavor of courtside style. “Can’t Catch Me Now” songstress Rodrigo put her signature preppy fashion on display, layering an inky-black vest over a plain white tee, paired with a short black miniskirt, white ankle socks, and chunky black patent leather lace-up loafers. She added dainty, feminine accents in the form of small, jewel-adorned earrings, a bracelet composed of quartz beads, several silver rings, and a small black purse. Rodrigo opted for her traditional glam of black winged eyeliner and a soft red lip, wearing her rich brown locks down and straight.;;
;;;Beside Rodrigo, “Greedy” hitmaker McRae oozed cool, in a long black leather trench coat over her own simple white tee, paired with slouchy light-wash jeans and two-tone gray and black sneakers. McRae accessorized her fit with chunky gold hoop earrings, chunky rings, and a small black leather purse. The singer and dancer finished off the look with glowy, bronzy glam, wearing shimmery gold eye shadow and a bright, glossy pink lip, while styling her blonde-highlighted hair down in soft waves.;;

;;;"Olivia Rodrigo is officially on a retro sneakers kick this summer. Just a month after showing off her retro Vans sneakers on Instagram, the star has been spotted out and about with yet another pair of classic sneakers from the ‘60s: the Nike Cortez.

Olivia Rodrigo was recently spotted enjoying a day out in London, England, with boyfriend Louis Partridge rocking a perfect summer uniform that she completed with a pair of these beloved Nike sneakers.

While riding around on a Lime bike and grabbing a bite in West London, Rodrigo donned a pair of black oval sunglasses and a small black bag, paired with a classic ribbed white tank top and a pair of flared black leggings from Alo. The GUTS singer added a pop of color, rocking a pair of red and white Nike Cortez on her feet, merging some of the biggest sneaker trends of the season.";;
;;;Rodrigo's Nike Cortez pick features an all-red upper with the brand's signature Swoosh detail in white, as well as white front laces. The main shoe is made of nylon-style fabric with contrasting suede details on the top and heel, as well as a thin white and red sole to complete the design. The style usually retails for $90, but it's currently on sale on the Nike website for around $77. If you use the promo code “SPORT,” you can score the shoes for less than $70 at the moment.;;
;;;While maintaining the retro flair, Rodrigo's style is a revamped version of the original Cortez, featuring a wider toe area and reinforced side panels for added comfort. As noted by Nike, the Cortez is one of the brand's most recognizable silhouettes ever. They were actually the first running shoe designed by Bill Bowerman, the brand's co-founder and renowned track and field coach.;;
;;;The Nike Cortez has been a staple in Nike's repertoire since it was designed in the 1960s and launched in the 1970s, permeating pop culture through its distinctive features and collaborations with notable figures such as Kendrick Lamar, Stranger Things, and Forrest Gump, among others. It has also recently earned the Gen Z stamp of approval, with the likes of Rodrigo and Suri Cruise sporting their pairs.;;

This summer, her trademark Y2K-meets-pop-punk style has been replaced with something much more laidback, and most recently, she embraced the minimalist summer dress trend with a cool-girl closet staple: Ciao Lucia's smocked cotton Gabriela Dress in black. (Oh, and she also posted a selfie of herself wearing this same dress to her Stories back in January, so clearly, she's a fan!!). Yep, it's a bit pricey at $295, but it's a classic dress that will last you forever, trust. Not looking to drop that much cash on a casual summer sundress?

Everyone from Kendall Jenner to Kaia Gerber to Sophia Bush has been spotted wearing the label's signature Gabriela Dress, which is beloved for its cute keyhole tie, flattering under-the-bust smocking, and on-trend midi length.;;

Yahoo Life;5 April 2024;Olivia Rodrigo Makes 2024's Underrated Color Trend Her Own;"Olivia Rodrigo may have undergone a subtle wardrobe evolution in the past few years, but the singer is always finding ways to infuse every occasion with pop-punk energy. Ahead of her GUTS Tour shows in New York City, the 21-year-old opted out of the springy lavender associated with her album art and instead relied on her Y2K-fueled DNA to elevate layers of muted colors.

On April 4, the ""Vampire"" singer was seen heading to her hotel in Midtown Manhattan in a white button-down shirt layered underneath a gray, thigh-hitting top coat flecked with multiple shades of the neutral tone. She added a casual twist to the classic business-casual silhouettes, including a pair of gray wash straight-leg jeans.";;https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/olivia-rodrigo-makes-2024s-underrated-141049677.html
;;;"Madewell The Curvy '90s Straight Jean

Rodrigo balanced her (many) shades of gray with laid-back accessories. She spruced up the look with a black beanie, Gentle Monster oval sunglasses, a leather shoulder purse, and—for the ultimate alternative twist—chunky Dr. Martens Jadon boots.

Rodrigo isn't necessarily associated with minimalism, but the ""Obsessed"" songstress has always preferred to take the relaxed route with her style, both on and off the red carpet. Working with stylist Danielle Goldberg, Rodrigo has dressed in designers from Sandy Liang to Vivienne Westwood with an understated, vintage-leaning aesthetic at the fore. Her relaxed uniform makes her colorway of choice for the day—charcoal grays—even more understated. Not only is the neutral hue easily adaptable in almost any outfit, as Rodrigo proves, but it's also been predicted on the Spring 2024 runways as a color trend to watch out for.";;
;;;"The ""charcoal gray"" (and other variations) was once deemed ""dull"" by the high-fashion majority, but in recent seasons, fashion houses such as Brandon Maxwell, Prada, and Ferragamo have reinvented the neutral shade. It's now viewed as dynamic and acts as an alternative (or complement) to black and/or white.

Color theory aside, Rodrigo's style still epitomizes one thing: Despite the seemingly never-ending churn of TikTok micro-trends, Gen-Z can, in fact, have a personal style.";;
Marie Claire;19 November 2024;Olivia Rodrigo Elevates Her Signature Makeup in a Luxurious First Lancôme Campaign;The star's go-to glam gets the spotlight treatment in her first photos for the brand.;;https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/olivia-rodrigo-signature-makeup-first-lancome-campaign/
;;;"Olivia Rodrigo was a beauty icon in the making long before Lancôme tapped her to become their latest global brand ambassador. When she rocketed to fame in 2021 with her chart-topping single ""Driver's License,"" the Gen Z It girl had already found her signature beat: winged black eyeliner and a glossy red lip. It's a failsafe makeup look she's continued to wear through two album cycles and accompanying sold-out tours. So, in a sense, little has changed.

With the Nov. 18 announcement of Rodrigo as the French beauty empire's freshest face, however, we're finally going to see what happens when a former Glossier girl grows up. In her first campaign for the luxury brand, the pop star's minimalist makeup routine gets a sophisticated upgrade mirroring the more mature direction of her newest album.

";;
;;;"In lieu of the Pro Tip liquid eyeliner and dusty rose Ultralip she generally favored during her Glossier brand ambassador days, Rodrigo has discovered new favorites in Lancôme's glossy black Lash Idôle Liner and L'absolu Rouge Cream Lipstick in Caprice De Rouge, a luminous cool red color. She's wearing a saturated swipe of both in the campaign imagery that dropped today, along with a dusting of Blush Subtil Powder Blush in a matte berry pink hue called Rose Fresque, an even layer of Teint Idôle Ultra Wear Foundation in shade 345N, and a black paillete tube dressfrom It Girl-beloved brand Guizio.

";;
;;;"Other key products for the campaign include a generous coat of Lancôme's jet-black lengthening mascara layered atop their nourishing lash primer—a necessary step to stop mascara from smudging, whether you're belting rock anthems on stage or simply spending a long day at the office.

Apparently, the Grammy winner's relationship with Lancôme goes much further back than her freshly inked deal. “I remember rifling through my mom's makeup bag and seeing Lancôme skincare in there,” Rodrigo told Vogue in an interview about her ambassadorship. “The serum was one of the first things I put on my face, before I really was doing skincare.”";;
;;;With Lancôme's expert team of makeup artists and developers at her disposal, it will be interesting to see whether Rodrigo begins to experiment more with her look, much the way she has with fashion in recent years. For instance, I would have loved to see the Grammy winner match her vintage Gucci thong and pencil skirt to a Y2K-inspired pop of icy blue eyeshadow at the Billboard Live Music Summit last week. Or perhaps the partnership will see her approach to beauty transform in other categories, such as with skincare or luxury perfume.;;

;;;"On the 2024 Grammys red carpet, Olivia Rodrigo went the vintage route—in a stunning white gown that has an even better backstory.

Rodrigo hit the carpet in Los Angeles for the 66th annual Grammy Awards wearing a champagne-colored slip dress from Versace that was originally released in 1995. The gown also featured a smattering of diamond embellishments that are going to look amazing on stage, should she win an award during tonight's presentation. (She's nominated for six awards for her sophomore album, Guts.)";;
;;;Rodrigo worked with stylist Danielle Goldberg—the genius behind our favorite looks from actresses like Greta Lee and Ayo Edebiri—to create the retro look. Eeagle-eyed fashion fans will know that this gown was worn by another icon: '90s fashion mainstay, supermodel Linda Evangelista. Rodrigo channeled this newfound classic energy by teaming the gown with old Hollywood curls, a classic red lip, and luminous skin.;;
;;;"The singer has worn vintage before, but this is by far her most glamorous look to date. It's a sharp change from the black dresses she's worn to the Grammys in the past. She wore a sheer black gown from Miu Miu in 2023 and an off-the-shoulder corseted gown from Vivienne Westwood in 2022. Rodrigo is slated to perform her hit song ""Vampire"" at tonight's ceremony, and I count myself among the legions of fans waiting to see what she'll wear on stage. Does this look mean the end of her Y2K-inspired frocks?";;

Wondering what to wear to an Olivia Rodrigo concert? Inspo can be found in Olivia's own GUTS Tour outfits, Easter eggs from her music videos, her lyrics, recent awards show performances, and red carpet looks. As expected, her first few stops on the tour so far have been a sea of butterflies, purple sequins, plaid mini skirts and punk platform boots.";;https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a45306487/what-to-wear-to-olivia-rodrigo-guts-concert/

While ""everything I do is tragic,"" wearing one of these GUTS Tour outfits certainly isn't (unless proper outfit pics aren't taken!!!!).";;
;;;"The ultimate source of GUTS Tour outfit inspiration: the looks Olivia has worn on stage thus far. Each night, she's come out in a new meme-worthy graphic tank that you can definitely put your own spin on. Take a nod from her Gwen Stefani ""I'm Just a Girl"" and Shania Twain ""Let's Go Girls"" tanks and pay homage to a music legend—or try a cutesy animal, funny word, or sexy saying like the ones she's worn.";;
;;;"Olivia Rodrigo's GUTS Tour wardrobe consists largely of bra tops, short-shorts, and fancy tights that—lucky for you—can easily be copied on a tight budget. Whether it's sparkly fishnets, rhinestone-embellished pantyhose, or star-print tights, everyone in your section will be asking ""Where did you get those?!"" Revealing your source to be Amazon is entirely up to you.

There, you'll find tees, hats, and hoodies that make for easy GUTS Tour outfits (and for less than $50). From trucker hats to butterfly graphic tees, this affordable Olivia Rodrigo merch deserves a spot in your closet, even if you didn't go to the Sour Tour.;;
;;;"When all else fails, wear something sparkly. While ""pretty isn't pretty enough,"" a sequin dress or top inspired by the looks Olivia has worn throughout the GUTS Tour will make you feel like a million bucks (and it'll make for an easy-to-repurpose party outfit). Throw on a tiara, slip on a rhinestone necktie, or steal a styling trick from Swifties and use this Conair hair jeweler to jazz up a night-out look you already own.";;
;;;Two albums into Olivia Rodrigo's career, one thing is clear: the girl loves purple. Much of the imagery for the GUTS album has featured violet hues, so you can expect to see many Olivia Rodrigo fans wearing purple at her upcoming shows. Whether it's a purple sequin top, lilac sneakers, or lavender acid-wash jeans, your GUTS Tour outfit will fit right in with the ambiance.;;
;;;"If ""all-american bitch"" was your anthem last summer, try an outfit with edgy schoolgirl vibes à la Olivia. Similar to the concert outfits at her Sour shows, there have been plenty of plaid mini skirts, undone neckties, and loafers so far at the GUTS Tour. Aesthetic-wise, think more along the lines of Nevermore Academy and less Constance Billard School for Girls.";;
;;;Wearing something straight from Olivia's wardrobe is a surefire way to stand out from the crowd. Perhaps it's her go-to Dr Martens or a pleated red mini skirt like the one she wore during her viral VMAs performance. Either way, a side-by-side of you and Olivia will make for an epic Instagram swipe.;;

;;;"Olivia Rodrigo was built to be a fashion icon.

We're only two months into the year, but the ""Vampire"" singer, 21, has already given us plenty of style inspiration for our mood boards — and she isn't done slaying yet.

On Feb. 23, she kicked off her Guts World Tour at the Acrisure Arena in Palm Springs, California, and rocked out in a handful of edgy, skin-baring looks that have only cemented her pop star status.";;
;;;With Guts, Rodrigo's sophomore album about bad decisions, love, heartbreak and self-reflection, the Grammy winner has committed to a grown-up version of the punk Y2K aesthetic she's been formulating since her Sour era.;;
;;;"She brought the same energy to opening night of the tour with her most daring looks yet. To paint the picture, Rodrigo belts her heart out wearing only a bra and hot pants at one point during the concert.

Her outfits are so good, we needed to break down each one, starting with this:";;
;;;"This blinding one that literally sparkles like a Twilight vampire in the sun. Rodrigo riles up her audience with head-banger ""Bad Idea Right?"" and we can all agree that having this set in her wardrobe was one of the best sartorial decisions Rodrigo's ever made.

Stylist and costume designer Heather Picchiottino sourced Rodrigo's custom Swarovski crystal mesh bralette and skirt from Michael Schmidt Studios. It's reminiscent of the singer's Ludovic de Saint Sernin VMAs gown, which was encrusted with 150,000 crystals from the high-end jeweler.";;
;;;"Then she goes a little darker with her style. Against a sea of backup dancers dressed in ballerina pink, the singer can't be missed in her black sequin bra and high-waisted hot pants (the risk-taking moment we were talking about before).

No great concert is without a quick-change and Rodrigo transforms her all-black look by throwing on a Rabanne minidress-style slip strung with see-through embellishments. Rodrigo's sexy side comes through even louder with this plunging red jumpsuit, which screams '80s rockstar (Rodrigo's pleated-skirt-to-hot-pants pipeline will be discussed another time). Picchiottino's custom-made ruby red one-piece, which is styled with ripped stocks speckled with glittery stars, makes perfect sense for Rodrigo's guitar jam session.";;
;;;"Rodrigo wasn't alive when No Doubt released ""Just a Girl"" in 1995. Yet here she is, nearly 30 years later, bringing Gwen Stefani's famous ""I'm just a girl"" feminist slogan to the spotlight again with a $20 tank top from online retailer Phantasy, which specializes in all things baby (as in Gen Z's favorite preferred way of saying ""shrunken crop top"").

It's all the more fitting because Guts is Rodrigo's love letter to girlhood. Across all 12 songs she belts, screams, and melodically sings about insecurities, growing up, idolization, beauty standards and, in this particular instance, fantasizing about getting back with her ex while simultaneously plotting his downfall for sweet, sweet revenge. Stefani and Rodrigo may have 33 years between them, but both understand what it's like to be a girl — it's messy, romantic and sometimes you just need to rock it out.";;

;;;Rodrigo's love of vintage is well-documented, and she definitely channeled Y2K era energy in a retired silk fit and flare polka dot slip dress from White House Black Market—which is currently shoppable secondhand on eBay for $10 or less (although listings at that price point don't seem likely to last long now that there's an OR connection to the dress).;;
;;;"Not only is the simple polka dot dress a timeless look, it's one that Rodrigo has personally worn versions of before—most notably in April 2024, when she was spotted in the now-sold out black and white polka dot Reformation Jessi Linen dress.

In terms of recreate-ability (which might not be a word, but definitely should be), it's hard to rate much higher than a classic black and white polka dot print dress. Similar styles are available from a range of brands and price points, below.";;
;;;Rodrigo paired the simple silk dress with another classic piece—a navy peacoat. The GUTS singer opted for a silk-lined coat with oversized fit and a large collar and wrist straps.;;

This makes Rodrigo just one of the It Girls (others include Hailey Bieber, Gigi Hadid, and Sydney Sweeney) who have been seen carrying Miu Miu's Aventure bag line of late.";;

Marie Claire;16 April 2024;"Olivia Rodrigo's Coachella Outfit Is Actually Custom Victoria's Secret
";The pop-punk princess wore her classic 'Guts' tour get-up with a twist;;https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/olivia-rodrigo-coachella-outfit-victorias-secret/
;;;"After a Mean Girls remake and a Y2K style renaissance, it looks like bright visible bra straps and underwear as outerwear are back. Olivia Rodrigo is leading the lingerie charge in a Coachella outfit featuring custom Victoria's Secret.

The pop-punk princess has been wearing bold bras under sheer-ish white ribbed tanks throughout her Guts tour, and during her surprise performance at Coachella this past weekend, Rodrigo upped the ante. She joined the legendary ska-rock, Gwen Stefani-fronted band No Doubt on the Coachella Main Stage to sing the band's single ""Bathwater"" on the second night of the annual music festival, marking both Rodrigo’s and No Doubt‘s first time performing at the festival.";;
;;;"Her typical Guts get-up consists of sparkly purple mini shorts, sheer black tights, heart necklaces, a bright red bra, and a series of white ribbed tank tops printed with phrases like ""Hopeful Romantic"" and ""Dump Him."" But on Saturday night, Rodrigo re-imagined the look after Stefani circa 2000. Styled by the duo Chloe and Chenelle Delgadillo, Rodrigo wore a white, customized Victoria’s Secret PINK rib crop tank top printed ""I <3 ND"" in the old English gothic font Gwen Stefani made her own in the early aughts. Under the tank, Rodrigo wore a Victoria’s Secret Customized Wear Everywhere Push Up Bra in the shade Red Pepper with black studs dotting the straps.";;
;;;"Rodrigo's dark navy Dickies 874 Work Pants steered the look away from feeling too girly—so did a chunky Georgina Trevino custom belt, engraved with her initials in the aforementioned gothic typeface.

The ""Vampire"" singer also traded out her Doc Martens for black Converse Chuck High Tops and replaced her classic heart-shaped jewelry with thick silver hoops and a silver chain. Instead of her usual long flowing locks, Rodrigo tied her hair up in a braided up-do that called to mind Stefani's No Doubt era hair styles.";;
;;;The Delgadillos and Rodrigo frequently work together on red carpet looks, music videos, and various performances and appearances. They also style stars like Kim Kardashian, Rosalía, SZA, and Addison Rae.;;
;;;Rodrigo wasn't the only artist reviving VS at Coachella. Styled by Mimi Cuttrell, Renée Rapp wore a black Victoria's Secret PINK seamless sports bra for her performance that same day. Meanwhile, Sabrina Carpenter worked with stylist Jared Ellner to source a vintage Victoria’s Secret sheer blue nightie set from 1997 to promote her Coachella set.;;
